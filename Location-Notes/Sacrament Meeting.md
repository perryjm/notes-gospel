# Sacrament Meeting Notes

## Grasslands 3rd Ward 2024-01-07
- [Aug 15, 2021 at 9:42 AM] I was sitting in church during the sacrament, and a thought hit me, “I should surrender over to heavenly father my desire to play video games.” So I did. Or, I asked for it to happen.

* God performs miracles 
* The Lord is speaking to us all the time, we just need to tune our senses. Like how you’ve trained your ears to ignore house sounds and tune in to children sounds or children choking sounds. So too can we train our spirit to hear the word of the Lord.
* Ministering is supposed to be church-ey. Christ can be everywhere at once. He would love to bless and pass the sacrament every week, but he can’t. He would love to walk the streets and hug people and help them feel loved constantly, but he can’t. That’s where we come in. That’s how we help. That’s what ministering is.

- I’m not having any impressions. But I’m frustrated in church today. I was late.

* You could do better
* Deep gospel studies are interesting and fun, they help keep high enthusiasms for rudimentary gospel study during the week

* Give your wife the love and tender caring that she yearns for. And things will go right. Always.
* Read your scriptures every single day. Before you accomplish anything else you must do this.
