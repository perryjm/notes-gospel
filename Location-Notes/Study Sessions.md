### 3 Nephi 11
“Hosanna! Blessed be the name of the Most High God!” - 3 Nephi 11:17

☝️ that is the hosanna shout. They did that when the savior arrived. Did he lead them in that shout?

### Baptism
One of the first thing Jesus does is asks by name for the prophet to come forward. Nephi does. And Jesus teaches baptism to all of them. He explains how to do it, and what to say.  Versus 24-26

“calling them by name, saying:

“25 Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.

“26 And then shall ye immerse them in the water, and come forth again out of the water.” 3 Nephi 11:24-26

He says immerse. You don’t find that word in the Bible. [See topical guide immersion](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/tg/baptism-immersion?lang=eng). You always find “buried with them” or some variation. But immerse is the exact right word. 

Baptism is one of the clearest ordinances explained in the scriptures. 

### Bar

### 3 Nephi 10
There was three hours of destruction. And then darkness. Like, *thick* darkness. Not even the stars could be shown. And even the driest of wood could not light for fire. And while they are mourning the loss of their loved ones, the Lord speaks to them, and basically tells them they were spared because they were more righteous than their brethren.

What a way to find out you’re on the right side? I guess. But what is the symbolism? What does it mean?
- You’re a survivor. Darkness, and then light in Ch. 11. 
- You knew someone who died. The mourning. You feel what the father felt. You feel what the apostles and Mary and Joseph felt in Jerusalem when Christ died. 
- To be coping with that loss, and then, the Lord comes. And you’re a believer. Basically everyone surviving is a believer. And that means they know Christ will conquer death. And when they see Him arrive the third day. They feel it. They know why he’s there. They understand what it means. It’s joyful because they’ll be with their loved ones again. Seeing Christ’s face means we will all live again. 

### [Do You Want to Be Happy?](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/26choi?lang=eng) By Elder Yoon Hwan Choi Of the Seventy. October 2023.
- “Do you want to be happy? What makes you unhappy? President Russell M. Nelson said: “If you want to be miserable, break the commandments—and never repent. If you want joy, stay on the covenant path.”[1](safari-reader://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/26choi?lang=eng#note1) Isn’t it simple to be happy? Just make covenants and keep them in your lives. Let us review some things that can help us to stay on the covenant path and make us happy.“

#### What is Gods Covenant Path
I liked this part.
- According to Elder Dale G. Renlund, “the term _covenant path_ refers to a series of covenants whereby we come to Christ and connect to Him. Through this covenant bond, we have access to His eternal power. The path begins with faith in Jesus Christ and repentance, followed by baptism and receiving the Holy Ghost.”[2](safari-reader://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/26choi?lang=eng#note2) We renew these covenants every time we partake of the sacrament.
- Beginning with the baptismal covenant, we make more covenants throughout our lives. Again, Elder Renlund said: “The covenant path leads to the ordinances of the temple, such as the temple endowment. The endowment is God’s gift of sacred covenants that connect us more fully to Him.”[3](safari-reader://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/26choi?lang=eng#note3)

This is very interesting. Everyone goes on about a covenant relationship. But I feel this is more what they’re talking about. Covenant bond. 

He says more on the topic of covenant bond like yoking with another person. 

“My wife says that our marriage yokes us together, and because of that she can do things she couldn’t do before. For example, ever since she was young, she has had a hard time going out in the dark, but it is not hard anymore because I go with her. She is short and cannot reach to the high shelves unless she uses a chair or ladder, but I can reach the things from high shelves for her because I am taller than her. Taking our Savior’s yoke upon us is like that. As we yoke ourselves to Him, we can do things we couldn’t do on our own because He can do the things we cannot do for ourselves.”

Elder David A. Bednar said: “Making and keeping sacred covenants yokes us to and with the Lord Jesus Christ. In essence, the Savior is beckoning us to rely upon and pull together with Him, even though our best efforts are not equal to and cannot be compared with His. As we trust in and pull our load with Him during the journey of mortality, truly His yoke is easy and His burden is light.”[8](safari-reader://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/10/26choi?lang=eng#note8)

## 2021-10-06

[Oct 6, 2021 at 8:58 AM]

### Alma 30-31:29

Korihor is tried among the ammonites who ship him up to Alma to be dealt with. Alma argues with him a bit and realizes he’s possessed with a lying spirit. Pretty much tells him if he wants a sign, he’ll be struck dumb. Korihor is struck dumb and then wishes he had admitted he did believe. Died among the Zoramites.

  

Alma learns of the pride of the Zoramites and wishes it weren’t so. Alma is sick because of the iniquity of the people. Goes up there to preach. Witnesses them praying on “the holy stand” and it’s worse than he thought. He begins praying for help. 

  

### 1 Kings 1

David gets very old. His son adonijah seeks to become king. Throws a party for himself and gets the support of some servants and priests. 

  

Bathsheba heard about this and consults David about a promise she remembers he made to her and her son Solomon. The prophet Nathan helps play a supporting role here to the king and bethsheba to see Solomon succeed David. They throw a party out him on the kings mule anoint Solomon and have him sit on the throne. And David publicly says I’m glad your my successor. And adonijah runs in fear. Solomon sends him to his home.

  

### Jesus the Christ 19: Parables: The wheat and the tares

Christ explains to the apostles after the parable, because they asked, that you can't just go through the field and get rid of the tares in the middle of the season, because you'll uproot the wheat also. So he says you have to wait until the end of the season, for the harvest, and then you can uproot everything, and separate the wheat from the tares, and bundle the tares for the fire, and put the wheat in the masters barn.

  

What does this teach me? I don't know I suppose. It's kind of an old skool "always been here" principle. The separation fo the wheat and the tares at the last day. It was novel in Christs time. I've grown up knowing it though. And because of this parable, I have a more correct understanding of what to expect after this life. Christ has adjusted my expectations. I'm grateful for this.

### Alma 26:1-26

Ammon is talking about their missionary work and aaron rebukes him saying your joy is carrying you into boasting. Which was probably true. But the story was written by ammon. So it seems untrue. Haha! 

  

### 2 Samuel 22-23

Davis’s big song. Actually pretty good. The last words of David. Also pretty deep. About a king ruling in righteousness and fearing the Lord. Names are given of David’s top warriors and bodyguards. Interesting. Storm light archives almost seem inspired by these verses. A mighty warrior who wasn’t considered part of the thirty or the top three warriors but was still amazing and was made head of the kings bodyguard. 

  

### Jesus the Christ 19: the wheat and the rates. 

The wheat is the good stuff. The rates are a noxious weed. We have the same problem in our lawn right now. And the reapers, the lords angels, are eager to harvest the wheat. But the lord tells them no. When it comes to harvesting this type of wheat (the souls of men and women), you have to demonstrate patience. And you have to let them grow together. Otherwise when you go to rip out the noxious weeds it will also uproot the wheat. In this case. You have to be careful to bundle up the rates and burn them in fire too early in the wheats life. 

  

What’s odd is, it’s obvious the lord considers some people now on the earth to be tares. Aren’t we all wheat? Aren’t we all people who need to be turned to the Lord? We are, but what does the lord say at the beginning? He servants come and say hey, your girls out there is growing tares. Didn’t you sow wheat? And the lord says, what? “An enemy hath done this.”

### Alma 25

Mostly shows how Abinadi’s original prophecy made about the wicked king Noah and his priests have all come true. Hunted or burned by fire. Burning by fire because of beliefs became a common practice, at least among Lamanites(?).

  

### 2 Samuel 18-21

King David and his army fight against Absalom and his army in the forest of Ephraim. 20k men die. It says the first swallowed up many of them. Absoloms mule passes under a tree and his hair gets completely tangled in a branch and is left hanging there from the tree branch helpless. Joab finds out about it and goes and runs several so ears through him killing him. Then they return and king David mourns his sons Absalom’s death instead of celebrating the victory or mourning the death toll on his own men. 

  

Joab seeks to correct the king and tells him you should go out and encourage your men instead of mourning the death of your son an enemy. David listens to Joab and goes out and the army of Israel is encouraged. 

  

Then there’s another rebellion from Sheba. And he tries to lead an army away. But joab is on it. And David sends joab to deal with the problem and they do. They end up pursuing Sheba all the way to this peaceful city Abel of wise people. A woman came out and talked with Joab and agreed to deliver Sheba in exchange for Joab to stop swinging the city. They threw Sheba’s head over the wall. And Joab returned to Jerusalem.

### Alma 18:1-12

King lamoni and servants convince themselves ammon is “the great spirit”. Then the king is astonished that ammon would continue following orders and prepare his horses and chariot for travel. King was astonished, wanted ammon to come talk to him. Ammon finished his work and then reported back. Noticed the kings countenance had chanted. So ammon turned back to walk away. 

  

Jesus the Christ 18: Christ’s mother and brethren come to see him

  

Christ chooses not to see his family when they come to see him. James e talmage relates this to missionary service and that he was setting an example for the apostles who were expected to devote all time and attention and talents to the work. 

  

### 2 Samuel 11-12

David illegitimately obtains the wife of Uriah the Hittite named bathsheba. She bares a son who dies. She bares another son who they name Solomon.

### Alma 17. 

Ammon and brothers depart. On missions. Ammon meets king Lamoni. Offered daughter to marry. Serves king by helping to watch his flocks. Flocks get scattered. Men cry for fear of execution as punishment. Ammon cuts off intruders arms with sword. Like some kind of super hero. 

  

Christ is teaching and this lady is like, “blessed be the breasts that suckled you! “ basically. And the Savior is like, “more blessed is he that listens to my message and follows it. “and I think that’s a kind way to get away from an awkward compliment. 

  

### 2 Samuel 8-10

David pretty much is owning. He wins at whatever he does. Whatever army comes against him they defeat. The lord is with him. Constantly. So, David wants to give back to Jonathan’s family because he once made a promise to him. So he finds the little boy who had both his ankle broken when running with his mother away from some danger. And treats him as a son. Has a servant serve him and his family the rest of his life there.

### Alma 16

Ammonihah’s is destroyed in one day by invading aggressive Lamanites. Becomes land of desolation of Nehors. Alma military leader understand Gods will to rescue the captives taken. The devil is considered beaten this round. 

  

### 2 Samuel 6-7

David brings the ark to the city of David. Story of Uzzah trying to stabilize the ark as it is falling because of the oxen. He touches the ark. And he struck dead 💀 . To me Uzzah seems innocent. Like “oh I’m just trying to help… ZAP”. I mean isn’t it the lord who says “do many things of your own free will and choice and bring to pass much righteousness”? Seems really inconsistent. But what do I know? I don’t know much. This whole story is a couple of lines in an incredibly old book. I don’t have all the facts. 

  

David dances in front of the tabernacle like the entire way. He gets scared after the Uzzah incident and leaves the ark somewhere for 3 months and then hears it’s blessing the people there, so he wants it in the city of David. As they’re bringing it into town, Michal sees David dancing “half naked” around and seeing the hand maids fawning over him she rebukes David later. But he pretty much tells her no, I was doing it for the Lord. She didn’t feel he was conducting himself very kingly. And he was doing it because that’s how he felt the ark was transported? I don’t know. It seems weird to me too. Obviously I don’t understand Jewish ark transporting protocols. 

  

Student manual says Michal took after Saul in her disbelief of the Lord. It says she kept little figures to other dieties. So she wasn’t necessarily a faithful member of the church. And she was rebuking David out of the pride of her heart. And David says look, I was chosen to be king in part because of your dads pride, and I will humiliate myself any day for the Lord. 

  

Then this last solemn line “Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.” Which I don’t know if that was David’s choice or hers. But it means they didn’t have any kids together, right? So is that the equivalent of a divorce today? David had a bunch of wives by this point. I don’t know. Or maybe it was the Lord? Took away her ability to have kids?

  

Then David wants to build a temple for the ark. And Nathan (which, where did Nathan come from? I have no idea 🤷) he says good idea whatever you do the lords with you, so…. Then Nathan has a dream and the lord says no you can’t build a temple. But I will establish you forever. And later David apparently tells Solomon (1 chronicles 22:8) that he was forbidden because of too much war and bloodshed he’d seen. “Thou hast shed blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood upon the earth in my sight.” Which is very very interesting.

### Alma 15

Zeezrom is at sidom, Alma and amulek arrive at sidom, Zeezrom hears about it, and sends for them. Asked to be healed. They heal him. According to his faith. He leaps out of bed. Harrowed up no more. Harrow means vex.

  

Jesus the Christ by Talmage 18: Christ’s authority ascribed to beelzebub

Interesting. Christ makes the logical point to his accusers, why would say an try to disrupt his own kingdom by having me destroy it? Plus how do your kids cast out devils? Plus, if I do it by the spirit of God, what that really means is the kingdom of god is here, through me, and you have to deal with that. 

  

2 Samuel 2-5

David is anointed king over house of Judah. Abner, sauls old military leader takes sauls son ishbosheth up to jezreel and makes him king of all Israel. David has a lot of wives and has more children. They stop counting the wives at this point. 

  

The Lord is with David at this point still. A weird battle takes place where 12 vs. 12 decides it. Abner vs. David’s servants. Abner kills one of three brothers who all are for David. Then the two brothers get revenge later. Abner tries to defect and come back to David’s side, but Joab kills him. David reprimands him and publicly disclaims the murder of Abner. Then two military leaders for ishbosheth kill the king ishbosheth and bring his head to David out in Hebron. David says, the last time someone came to me claiming to have killed the king of Israel I killed him. What should I do with you? So he had the two military leader brothers killed for beheading ishbosheth. 

  

Then david goes and conquers Jerusalem by the water shaft and jebusites blind and lame people up there? Calls it the city of David and Zion.

### Alma 14

The chief judge of the land had to have known who Alma was, because, didn’t Alma used to be chief judge? Like, not that long ago. But the chief judge apparently was in there slapping Alma too. Crazy. Foolish thing, to slap and mock a prophet. Don’t do it. 

  

My favorite lion, and the people saw Alma and Amulek walking out of the prison with the crumbling walls, and ran from their presence with great fear, like a goat flees with her young from two lions. 

  

### 2 Samuel 1

David heard about sauls death from a boy, an amalekite, who apparently helped Saul Kill himself? Saul wasn’t quite dead? So Saul saw the boy and asked him to help kill him. And the boy could see, yeah you’re not going to make it. So he did. And then took his bracelet and something else, and came and told David. David rent his clothes, and the other men also did, and then they killed the messenger, because he claimed to have killed Saul, the Lords anointed. Wild. Then David writes a song about it. 

  

Jesus the Christ by Talmage 18: Christ at dinner, forgives a woman washing his feet.

  

She could have been from the sermon spoken earlier that day. We don’t know. The world often falsely claims it was Mary Magdelene. But talmage says there is no scriptural evidence for that claim. The point is Christ shares a parable right there at that moment. And he says, Simon you offered me no hospitality and she washed and anointed my feet. Which sinner loves their forgiver more? The one who owes $500 or $50? Simons like, the one who owes $500. And Christ is like “ding ding ding, you’re right!” So we learn that this is something we need to do better. Not judge other sinners. 

  

It’s also interesting to note that right here, Christ also uses the concept of money owed to teach about forgiveness of sins. Even though it’s not about trade for trade, he still uses that concept to teach people. I think that’s important.

### 1 Sam. 30-31

David intercepts the raiding party on advise from an Amalekites abandoned Egyptian slave. Gave him tips. They defeat that raiding party and get their plunder back. David shared it with the men who came with him and the men who stayed behind. Unity. 

  

Elsewhere Saul is critically wounded by archers, and falls on his own sword to avoid brutal torcher. The phillistines decapitate him and hang his armor in their temple, and hang his body from the wall of one of their cities. Sad day in Israel. 

  

men of Sauls hometown go out and reclaim his body and burn and bury it by a fig tree. 

  

### Alma 13:17-end

Alma encourages repentance before it’s too late. Basically. 

  

Jesus the Christ by talmage. 18: death of John the Baptist. 

  

Herodias’ daughter was named Salome. And she was just as nasty as her mother. Bad people. Her mother wanted John dead. Herod didn’t want him dead. John was already in prison because of some weird compromise worked out between Herod and Herodias. 

  

But I guess the point is the Lord could have easily delivered John. Send an angel. Speak a word and the locks to the prison open and the guards fall asleep. You know? He could have easily freed John. But that wasn’t the point. Sometimes the Lord suffers it, so that the blood of the innocent cry from the dust to the condemnation of the perpetrator.

### Alma 12:1-17 
Alma is talking to Zeezrom and basically telling him why he won’t fully get what he is saying. 

  

### 1 Samuel 29 and 30:1-20 
David gets ratted out by phillistine leaders? And goes over to Israel’s side. Achish leading Israel in this battle tells David he has no quarrel with him and to go back to get his people. David goes back to find that the Phillistines plundered his camp while he was gone. Stole his supplies and wives.

  

Jesus the Christ

The savior is teaching people about
