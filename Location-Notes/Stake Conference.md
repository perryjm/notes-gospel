# Stake Conference


## Springville West Stake Priesthood meeting Oct 22, 2023
**Prez Bills**  

There has always been a percentage of people who come and go in the church, and there has always been a percentage of people who stick by the savior through thick and thin. There has been a lot of over amplified voices in the social media sphere that it’s crazy how much attention those are getting, but that’s not the truth. 

  

  

We live in the most difficult nation in the world to be a member of the church

There are more young people serving as missionaries as a percentage than have ever served in the past

21st century American culture in a time and a place where it is very unpopular to say there is truth. To say something is right or wrong. 

We have been called to be fire tested to stand up and testify of Jesus Christ in high school and junior high school. May not be tougher anywhere else in the world 

  

Please don’t think for a second that anything is happening that is stopping the lords work from progressing. Most wonderful time in the history of the world. 

Are temples outpacing the growth of the church? what happens when the lord comes and let’s 2B people know he is a member of the church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints?

  

Don’t be fooled by a minority of people on social media. 

Every prophecy will be fulfilled. 

Zion is being established and it will be established. That’s not going to change

  

Ephraomotes will bring in and gather from the four corners of the earth. It’s our call to live in this environment for a little longer.  

Navigating workplace and high school environments where it’s not popular to say you have faith or you believe in Jesus Christ

  

Youth coming back from fsy saying. I couldn’t believe how many of us there were. The world had cowed people. Springville is filled with plenty of people of faith

  

I implore you to rise and stand and declare what you believe. There is a very big difference between judgmental ness and truth speaking. We can be bold. And we can speak lovingly. 

  

The lord will have your back if you are willing to have his. If you stand for what is right and testifying of truth and be filled with his love and testifying of Jesus Christ. He will move you about in your professions and places you need to be. He will protect you. He will keep you safe. We must eliminate the fear of standing and being counted amongst the faithful

  

One scripture. Helaman 13 “which thing is contrary to that righteousness that is in our great and eternal head”

  

The law that governs happiness is the oath and covenant of the priesthood. Defend the name of Jesus Christ. And the good name of His church. That is living according to the manner of happiness. As we serve him and give our lives to him. I testify Jesus is the Christ. He has called a prophet. This is his church. And his kingdom. 

  

  

**Prez Packer**

  

Young men in our stake was of the tribe of Levi. Had to call the area offices to clarify because they can serve as bishop without being a high priest. 

  

Joseph smith. Worries about his own soul at 14 years old. 

  

He just referred to James as “the brother of the Savior”

  

God came and appeared. 

  

The only reason this church survived fights and church basketball and false doctrine in elders quorum, is because we have the power of the priesthood restored. No other church in this planet can claim the same thing. 

  

Gave us his line of authority. 

  

You renew all of your covenants as you partake of the sacrament. Without that binding to the lord we are all lost. He is the way. The way we bind ourselves to him is through covenants and ordinances that have been restored and are performed by the power and authority of the priesthood. 

  

Story of Kiev prisoner. Mal nutrition. Allah save me. Jesus Christ appeared to him. 

  

Stump in Ukraine. Bible. What converted him most was the woman caught in adultery. Let him without sin cast the first stone. Jesus was more than a prophet. He was the savior of the world. 

  

Found a woman. Couldn’t get married. Because he was illegal in Ukraine. They started a family. Had a son. 17 yrs later. Missionaries knocked on their door. Book of Mormon. Gospel restored. They begged to be baptized. Needed to be married first. Ukraine government wouldn’t let him. 

  

**Questions**

My son has friends who talk about lgbtq and think sometimes they might be gay

  

The best way to inoculate your children against the influences of the world, and that is to teach them the plan of salvation. 

  

One of the teachings of the world, is you need to be true to yourself and that means when you have a thought follow it. 

  

Teach your children who they are, and what the plan is. And the voices they hear outside the home may be things they can’t trust. As they make decisions that are not helpful to their own salvation. You have to be a warning voice. You can’t just love. You have to teach the truth. You love them and help guide them. Show them an example of what a Christian does. Don’t be afraid to share the truth that you know. 

  

I had tough times in my marriage. And I had to get in my knees and listen to what I needed to do to save my marriage. And that doesn’t 

  

The United Nations doesn’t hold as much power as you all hold in this room.
