### Sacrament Meeting Notes



## Grasslands 3rd Ward 2023-03-27

* God performs miracles 

* The Lord is speaking to us all the time, we just need to tune our senses. Like how you’ve trained your ears to ignore house sounds and tune in to children sounds or children choking sounds. So too can we train our spirit to hear the word of the Lord.

* Ministering is supposed to be church-ey. Christ can be everywhere at once. He would love to bless and pass the sacrament every week, but he can’t. He would love to walk the streets and hug people and help them feel loved constantly, but he can’t. That’s where we come in. That’s how we help. That’s what ministering is.
