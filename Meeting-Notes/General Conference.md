# General Conference Notes



## 2021-04
I have to start using this tool more often. It works surprisingly well. It syncs with the digital library very well now. I need to start really leaning into this tool. 

  

What questions do I have?

  

- Why did Nephi go and do?  
    
- Why are people caring so much about race these days?  
    
- How can I overcome my social anxieties and do something for my ministering families?  
    
- How can I better teach the elders quorum?
- How do I push through and teach from a conference talk I consider “boring”?
-
