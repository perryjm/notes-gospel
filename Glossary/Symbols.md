Symbology, symbols

A gospel symbol can be an object, event, action, or teaching that represents a spiritual truth ([source](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/ensign/2007/02/why-symbols)). All things are made to bear record of Jesus Christ ([Moses 6:63](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6?lang=eng&id=p63#p63)). All things are spiritual to the Lord ([D&C 29:31-35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual-2017/chapter-12-doctrine-and-covenants-29?lang=eng&id=p35#p35)). Temporal is in the likeness of the spirit and the spirit is in the likeness of the temporal ([D&C 77:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77?lang=eng&id=2#p2)).

Symbols are analogies. They are comparisons. They are metaphors. They are physical and visual teaching tools. They are an aid or enhancement in the teaching/learning process.

They are not a replacement for foundational understanding of doctrine.

## Benefits
- Universal language - no need for translation
- Ubiquitous - “All things are made to bear record of me” [Moses 6:63](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.63?lang=eng#p63)
- Protects deeply spiritual things from worldly ridicule
- “Grant eloquence in the expression of feelings”

## Drawbacks
- Very few verified interpretations available (though we do have the gift of the Holy Ghost)
- Must first understand spiritual truth to see symbols of it.
- For example, teaching an investigator about Joseph Smith and the restoration, we don’t simply set a lamp on the table and say “this light bulb will reach you everything you need to know about the restoration.” Despite the fact that much depth can be learned about the doctrine of the restoration from the symbolism of a light bulb spreading light into a dark room.

## Symbols and Doctrine are Reciprocal and Recursive
1. Understand the spiritual truth (doctrine)
2. Notice symbols of it. 
3. Notice new and richer details about the symbol due to its real world counterpart
4. Take those new observations back to the scriptures for further verification and enhanced learning
5. Repeat steps 1-4
