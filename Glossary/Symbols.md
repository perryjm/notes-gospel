### Symbols and Doctrine are Reciprocal and Recursive
1. Understand the spiritual truth (doctrine)
2. Notice symbols of it. 
3. Notice new and richer details about the symbol due to its real world counterpart
4. Take those new observations back to the scriptures for further verification and enhanced learning
