Purity means… “Free from sin or guilt; blameless. A person becomes pure when his thoughts and actions are clean in every way. A person who has committed sin can become pure through faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, and receiving the ordinances of the gospel.“ - [guide to the scriptures](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/gs/pure-purity?lang=eng)
