Communication with Heavenly Father. We are all children of God. He loves us and knows our needs, and He wants us to communicate with Him through prayer. We should pray to Him and no one else.

	- "As we make a habit of approaching God in prayer, we will come to know Him and draw ever nearer to Him. Our desires will become more like His. We will be able to secure for ourselves and for others blessings that He is ready to give if we will but ask in faith."

	- if anyone “shall pray and not with real intent of heart … it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth none such” ([Moroni 7:9](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.9?lang=eng#p9)).
	- To make our prayers meaningful, we must pray with sincerity and “with all the energy of heart” ([Moroni 7:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.48?lang=eng#p48)). We must be careful to avoid “vain repetitions” when we pray (see [Matthew 6:7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/6.7?lang=eng#p7)).
	- Always give thanks to Heavenly Father. We should “live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon \[us\]” ([Alma 34:38](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/34.38?lang=eng#p38)). As we take time to remember our blessings, we will recognize how much our Heavenly Father has done for us. We should express our thanks to Him.
- "And when thou prayest thou shalt not do as the hypocrites, for they love to pray, standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, they have their reward. But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly. But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking." ([3 Nephi 13:5-7](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13?lang=eng&id=p5-p7#p5))
