# Atonement of Jesus Christ

The atonement of Jesus Christ is power. It is His power that he lends to you to change your life and repent. It is His power granted to you to heal, restore, sanctify, be resurrected, and perfected. Jesus Christ obtained this power from our Heavenly Father when he suffered, bled from every pore, and was hung on the cross and died there. He became the Redeemer. The atonement of Jesus Christ reverses the effects of the fall of Adam and Eve.

## My Favorite Scriptures
- [D&C 122:5-8](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/122?id=5-8&lang=eng#p5) Says it all. Truly.


## Thoughts on Quid Pro Quo Model
Some mistake the atonement of Jesus Christ to be a "something for something" trade, similar to our modern economy. They use the analogy of money, debt, and paying prices for goods to paint a picture of man as a debtor and Christ as intermediary between debtor and lender, the one demanding mercy and the other justice.

As in [this article](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/atonement-of-jesus-christ), they use phrases like, "to pay the price for our sins," or "because He had no debt to justice, he could pay the debt for those who repent."

This is a decent model for understanding the Atonement of Jesus Christ. But as with all models, it is an over-simplification. This is not the model used in the scriptures to teach us about the atonement of Jesus Christ.

- Christ came in the meridian of time. How did He or the Father already know the exact price incurred by all sin from all of humanity that ever lived or would yet live on the earth?
	- Human life is so deterministic they know exactly how many sins I will commit?
	- What about other planets as some theories suggest the Savior is Redeemer to those planets as well?
