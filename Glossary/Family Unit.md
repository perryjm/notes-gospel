[Family Proclamation](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world/the-family-a-proclamation-to-the-world?lang=eng)

The family unit is the fundamental unit of society. The key building block for all successful societies. Currently under attack from every possible angle. It consists of a father, mother, and children.

Many movements tout high ideals. They claim to be pro-women, pro-animal, pro-earth, pro-inclusion, or pro-choice, but ultimately are anti-family.

## Spouses Commanded to Love Each Other
“Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else.“ D&C 42:22

## Good Partners
“Sustainable improvements in any endeavor depend on collaboration and agreement. Great leaders and partners develop the skill of sharing insights and efforts and the pattern of building consensus. Great partners are completely loyal. They suppress personal ego in exchange for being part of creating something larger than themselves. Great partnerships are dependent upon each individual developing his or her own personal attributes of character.” - [Elder Russel M Nelson. BYU Speech, ‘Disciples of Jesus Christ—Defenders of Marriage’](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/russell-m-nelson/disciples-jesus-christ-defenders-of-marriage/).

## Marriage Made by God
“Marriage was not created by human judges or legislators. It was not created by think tanks or by popular vote or by oft-quoted bloggers or by pundits. It was not created by lobbyists. Marriage was created by God!” - [Elder Russel M Nelson. BYU Speech, ‘Disciples of Jesus Christ—Defenders of Marriage’](https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/russell-m-nelson/disciples-jesus-christ-defenders-of-marriage/).
