Temples are literally houses of the Lord. They are places where individuals can go to make sacred promises with God, feel His Spirit, and escape from the hectic demands of day-to-day life. [Come unto christ Site](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist/article/temples)

## Why do Latter-Day Saints have temples?
Temples have been around for a long time. Moses had a tabernacle, Solomon built a beautiful temple, and Jesus taught at the temple in Jerusalem. Today, temples are built all over the world. In over 140 temples worldwide, faithful members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints find opportunities for peaceful reflection and for learning more about God’s plan of happiness. Inside temples, couples can be married for eternity, not just “’til death do you part.” Church members can also perform baptisms and other ordinances for their loved ones who died without receiving these blessings.

## Guidelines When Discussing the Temple

### Guideline #1
_Because we love the Lord, we always should speak about His holy house with reverence. We should not disclose or describe the special symbols associated with the covenants we receive in sacred temple ceremonies. Neither should we discuss the holy information that we specifically promise in the temple not to reveal._

### Guideline #2
_The temple is the house of the Lord. Everything in the temple points us to our Savior, Jesus Christ. We may discuss the basic purposes of and the doctrine and principles associated with temple ordinances and covenants_.

“We do not discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples”

(Preparing to enter the Holy Temple, 2)

## What are the covenants we make in the temple?

- Law of Obedience, which includes striving to keep God’s commandments.
- Law of Sacrifice, which means doing all we can to support the Lord’s work and repenting with a broken heart and contrite spirit.
- Law of the Gospel, which is the higher law that He taught while He was on the earth.
- Law of Chastity, which means that we have sexual relations only with the person to whom we are legally and lawfully wedded according to God’s law.
- Law of Consecration, which means dedicating our time, talents, and everything with which the Lord has blessed us to building up Jesus Christ’s Church on the earth.
