# Stripling Warriors
#character-profile 
Band of 2000 young men who initially served in the Nephite army under the direction of Helaman, under Moroni. Well known for, “we do not doubt, our mothers knew it” ([Alma 56:48](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/56?lang=eng&id=48#p48))

## Our Mothers Knew It
1. Parents made a covenant that they would no more pickup a weapon to harm their brother.
2. That covenant the people made doesn’t extend to their children.
3. During this time, Nephites having a huge struggle, as a nation, against the Lamanites.
4. Ammonites sent their boys out to battle. hard for any mother, I'm sure.
5. These **mothers** were powerful. And they demanded something of God.
6. They demanded his protection. His protection for their boys. And in exchange, they would become testifiers, or they had already become testifiers, because their boys knew it. They all knew "it."
7. What is "it"?
8. **They knew that if they trusted in the Lord and kept His commandments, He would deliver them, He would protect these boys. Their mothers had taught them this.**
9. Their Mothers knew it. How? Well, the Spirit. But also because of the example of Ammon and King Mosiah, their missionary, who preached to their people and aided in their conversion and escape from the Lamanites in the first place.
10. They witnessed it, first hand.
11. Ammon's father, King Mosiah, required the *very* same thing of the Lord. Protection for his boys, in exchange for faithfulness, and their serving faithful missions among the Lamanites.
12. Ammon was protected miraculously by God on many occasions on his mission. This happened, in part, on account of his fathers faith and promise worked out with the Lord that if he let his boys go out on missions among the Lamanites that **the Lord would protect them** from harm from the Lamanites. And the Lord did exactly that. All those boys came home safely. 
13. When I review this story, the spirit whispers to me, "it's true. it is totally true. The Lord keeps his promises."
14. So these mothers knew that. And they loved their boys. But they knew that their boys could be part of something greater. They could greatly help in this fight for the lives of the Nephites.
15. And so they made a big sacrifice. They commended their boys to the Lord. They trusted in the Lord that He could make something wonderful of their boys in this greater effort. They trusted the Lord, and they made a deal with the Lord. And He came through BIG.


## Ammonites (Anti-Nephi-Lehis), Looking Deeper

The people of Ammon were no slouches. They also sent provisions. They also had great skill with the sword. It wasn’t because they were bad with the sword that they gave it up. It was because they didn’t want to stain their souls anymore with the blood of their brethren. And they knew, that if they did once more, they might not be able to repent of that. So they quit fighting with the sword and buried their weapons. They didn't trust themselves, to dance with that behavior anymore.

These people were ferocious. Maybe even blood thirsty. They had a bit of a problem with blood shed. I wasn’t there. But I often relate the people of Ammon to addicts, because all the trappings are there. They had to kick a habit that was built into them and they had to do some dramatic things to make a boundary and then choose to stay within that bound. They didn’t want to kill anymore. And they felt that even picking up the sword for the most righteous purposes, that of defending your own life or the life of your family, they found they couldn't even do that for fear that the act of bloodshed would once again stir that temptation to go and shed more blood.

Now, just imagine what such a spiritually strong people like that would produce for offspring. Imagine kids growing up in a community like that. What are the stories those parents are going to be telling their kids? Stories of faith. Stories of repentance. Stories of sacrifice, covenants, blessings and peace. Testimonies of total lifestyle shifts, and coming unto the Lord.
  
These kids had no option of growing up and not knowing perfectly well how the Lord works with our souls. It was part of their parents entire way of life. Their parents studied the word of God because their very lives depended on it, their souls depended on it.

The whole reason they left the Lamanites and moved over to Nephite territory was to get away from that life style. They buried their weapons. Not fighting in any wars but supporting the Nephite troops with provisions as the Nephites protected them. 

How hard that must have been for them. The humility of that. To be a great warrior yourself but to then willingly choose to no longer fight. Because you knew it turned you into a blood thirsty person, who might not be able to be redeemed anymore. 

It’s not because your bad at war that you have to quit. It’s because your good at war that you have to quit. It’s because you saw where your soul was pointed and where it was headed that you decided, I have to turn this around, I have to make some big changes or else my soul is going to be hurled away to Hell forever. 

## Parenting

How does this apply to me?

Easy. I’m a parent who has been delivered from bondage by the Lord God Almighty Himself. He did deliver me from bondage. Just like He delivered the people of Ammon from their bondage. 

And what did those people do afterwards? They became testaments, all of them, to the power of God. Their whole lifestyle testified to all onlookers that the Lord delivered them from bondage, and that the Lord loves them. 

How soon I forget. How soon I forget the miracles the Lord has done for me. I need to live my life such that all onlookers can see plainly that the Lord has delivered me out of the clutches of hell. The Lord has preserved me with his mighty arm. His hand was stretched out still. 

Perhaps the most significant people the Ammonites testified to and witnessed to of the Lords mighty deliverance, were their children. They apparently taught their sons and daughters in very clear terms that if they would do likewise, and trust the Lord, then He would deliver them from bondage too. Because in the moment when they most needed faith, they had it, and they attributed it to their parents. Their mothers, in fact. 

I am a parent, and I need to do the exact same thing. I need to tell the story, often, and in no uncertain terms, of how the Lord delivered me from bondage. And how trusting in the Lord proved the greatest decision I ever made in life. All good things in my life came to me as a result of trusting in God.

“..we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe—that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.

“27 Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.” -Alma 57:26-27

- “In the Book of Mormon we read about 2,000 exemplary young men who were exceedingly valiant, courageous, and strong. ‘Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him’ (Alma 53:21). These faithful young men paid tribute to their mothers. They said, ‘Our mothers knew it’ (Alma 56:48). … “The responsibility mothers have today has never required more vigilance. More than at any time in the history of the world, we need mothers who know. … When mothers know who they are and who God is and have made covenants with Him, they will have great power and influence for good on their children” (Julie B. Beck, “[Mothers Who Know,](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/liahona/2007/11/mothers-who-know?lang=eng&id=p3-p4#p3)” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2007, 76).
