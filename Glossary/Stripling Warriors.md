##  Motherhood

This is one of the biggest testaments to motherhood in all the scriptures. But I fear I may not understand. 

These people made a covenant that they would no more pickup a weapon to harm their brother. And the Lord blessed them immensely, as a people. Ammonites. Anti-nephi-lehi’s. Right?

But that covenant the people made doesn’t extend to their children. And so, their children could go to war. The Nephites we’re having a huge struggle, as a nation. So the ammonites sent their boys out to battle. As it is hard for any mother. I’m sure. 

But these mothers were powerful. And they demanded something of God. They demanded his protection. His protection for their boys. And in exchange, they would become testifiers, or they had already become testifiers, because their boys knew it. They all knew it. They knew that if they trusted in the Lord, that He would deliver them. Their mothers had taught them this.

And I suppose they had learned it from their own experience, which began first with Ammon who himself was protected miraculously by God on many occasions on account of his fathers faith, and promise worked out with the Lord that if he let his boys go out on missions among the Lamanites that the Lord would protect them from harm from the Lamanites. And the Lord did exactly that. All those boys came home safely. 

So these mothers knew that. And they loved their boys. But they knew that their boys could be part of something greater. They could greatly help in this fight for the lives of the Nephites. And so they commended their boys to the Lord. They trusted in the Lord that He could make something of their boys and their sacrifice by giving their boys to the Lord. And trusting in Him. 


## Ammonites, Looking Deeper

The people of Ammon were no slouches. They also sent provisions. They also had great skill with the sword. It wasn’t because they were bad with the sword that they gave it up. It was because they didn’t want to stain their souls anymore with the blood of their brethren. And they knew, that if they did once more, they might not be able to repent of that. So they quit fighting with the sword and buried their weapons. 

These people were ferocious. Maybe even blood thirsty. They had a bit of a problem with blood shed. I wasn’t there. But I often relate the people of Ammon to addicts, because all the trappings are there. They had to kick a habit that was built into them and they had to do some dramatic things to make a boundary and then choose to stay within that bound. They didn’t want to kill anymore. 

Now just imagine what such a spiritually strong people like that would produce for offspring. Imagine kids growing up in a community like that. What are the stories those parents are going to be telling their kids? Stories of faith. Stories of repentance. Stories of sacrifice, covenants, blessings and peace. 
  
These kids had no option of growing up and not knowing perfectly well how the Lord works with our souls. It was part of their parents entire way of life. The whole reason they left the Lamanites and moved over to Nephite territory. Burying their weapons. Not fighting in any wars but supporting the Nephite troops with provisions as the Nephites protected them. 

How hard that must have been for them. The humility of that. To be a great warrior yourself but to then willingly choose to no longer fight. Because you knew it turned you into a blood thirsty maniac. 

It’s not because your bad at war that you have to quit. It’s because your good at it that you have to quit. 

It’s because you saw where your soul was pointed and where you were headed that you decided, I have to turn this around, I have to make some big changes or else my soul is going to be hurled away to Hell. 

## Parenting

How does this apply to me?

Easy. I’m a parent who has been delivered from bondage by the Lord God Almighty Himself. He did deliver me from bondage. Just like He delivered the people of Ammon from their bondage. 

And what did those people do afterwards? They became testaments, all of them, to the power of God. Their whole lifestyle testified to all onlookers that the Lord delivered them from bondage, and that the Lord loves them. 

How soon I forget. How soon I forget the miracles the Lord has done for me. I need to live my life such that all onlookers can see plainly that the Lord has delivered me out of the clutches of hell. The Lord has preserved me with his mighty arm. His hand was stretched out still. 

Perhaps the most significant people the Ammonites testified to and witnessed to of the Lords mighty deliverance, were their children. They apparently taught their sons and daughters in very clear terms that if they would do likewise, and trust the Lord, then He would deliver them from bondage too. Because in the moment when they most needed faith, they had it, and they attributed it to their parents. Their mothers, in fact. 

I am a parent, and I need to do the exact same thing. I need to tell the story, often, and in no uncertain terms, of how the Lord delivered me from bondage. And how trusting in the Lord proved the greatest decision I ever made in life. All good things in my life came to me as a result of trusting in God.

“..we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe—that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.

“27 Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.” -Alma 57:26-27
