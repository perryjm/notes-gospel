# Flesh and Blood
The scriptures consistently refer to “flesh and blood” when speaking of us mortals here on earth and in mortality. This stands in contrast with “flesh and bones” as we see the Father and the Son have. 

## Possible Interpretations 
- Blood is a symbol of mortality.


## Scriptural Examples
- Blood cries unto the Lord from the dust. The blood of the prophets cries unto the Lord to be avenged. 3 Nephi
- “… when the resurrection and exaltation of man shall be consummated, although more pure, refined and glorious, yet will he still be in the same image, and have the same likeness, without variation or change in any of his parts or faculties, except the substitution of spirit for blood." (Mediation and Atonement, pp. 160-161.) President John Taylor. Mormon Doctrine. Evolution.
