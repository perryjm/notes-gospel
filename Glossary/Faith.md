Faith means we believe in Jesus Christ and his appointment and mission AND we obey him. Faith without works is dead, so we actually have to take action in accordance with that belief.

Faith is not only believing ***in*** Christ, but believing Christ. Meaning we take the Savior at his word, and trust those words, we believe and trust that He’ll do as he says he’ll do.
