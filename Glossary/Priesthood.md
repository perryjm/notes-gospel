Priesthood

Simplistic definition: The ability to act in God’s name here on the earth. 

  

Complex definition: The authority God assigns to man in an orderly fashion, for the performing of binding ordinances here on earth which support all of the children of God. 

  

Question: Why can’t women hold that priesthood, formally, like men do? What’s the difference between doctrine and tradition?

  

Question: Where in the scriptures specifically does it say Priesthood is a male-only thing? I’m just curious.

Priestesses 

(Priestesses ) 

See CALLING AND ELECTION SURE, CELESTIAL MARRIAGE, ENDOWMENTS, EXALTATION, KINGS, MELCHIZEDEK PRIESTHOOD, PRIESTHOOD, PRIESTS, QUEENS. 

Women do not have the priesthood conferred upon them and are not ordained to offices therein, but they are entitled to all priesthood blessings. Those women who go on to their exaltation, ruling and reigning with husbands who are kings and priests, will themselves be queens and priestesses. They will hold positions of power, authority, and preferment in eternity. (Gospel Kingdom, pp. 221-222, 229.) 

  

(High Priestesses ) 

See HIGH PRIESTS, PRIESTESSES, PRIESTHOOD. 

There is no such thing in the true Church as a high priestess. Where this office is found in a church, it is an unauthorized and apostate innovation. Women do not hold the priesthood.

As pertaining to eternity, priesthood is the eternal power and authority of Deity by which all things exist; by which they are created, governed, and controlled; by which the universe and worlds without number have come rolling into existence; by which the great plan of creation, redemption, and exaltation operates throughout immensity. It is the power of God. (Discourses, new ed., p. 130; Gospel Kingdom, p. 129.) 

  

As pertaining to man's existence on this earth, priesthood is the power and authority of God delegated to man on earth to act in all things for the salvation of men. It is the power by which the gospel is preached; by which the ordinances of salvation are performed so that they will be binding on earth and in heaven; by which men are sealed up unto eternal life, being assured of the fulness of the Father's kingdom hereafter; and by which in due course the Lord will govern the nations of the earth and all that pertains to them. (Gospel Doctrine, 5th ed., pp. 136-200.) 

  

Priesthood is eternal

“The Priesthood is everlasting.”

Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p158

  

“priesthood is as eternal as God Himself, having neither beginning of days nor end of life.”

Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, p323

  

As there is only one God and one power of God, it follows that there is only one priesthood, the eternal priesthood. Thus the Prophet taught: "All priesthood is Melchizedek, but there are different portions or degrees of it." (Teachings, p. 180.) Also: "Its institution was prior to 'the foundation of this earth, or the morning stars sang together, or sons of God shouted for joy,' and is the highest and holiest priesthood, and is after the order of the Son of God, and all other priesthoods are only parts, ramifications, powers and blessings belonging to the same and are held, controlled, and directed by it." (Teachings, p. 167.)

—

“An ordinance is most commonly officiated by persons who have been ordained to an office in the priesthood acting under the direction of one who holds priesthood keys. For example, the holders of the various offices of the Aaronic Priesthood officiate in the ordinance of the sacrament under the keys and direction of the bishop, who holds the keys of the Aaronic Priesthood. The same principle applies to the priesthood ordinances in which women officiate in the temple. Though women do not hold an office in the priesthood, they perform sacred temple ordinances under the authorization of the president of the temple, who holds the keys for the ordinances of the temple.”

Dallin H. Oaks. The Melchizedek Priesthood and the Keys. April 2020.

  

  

“The word priesthood has two meanings.”

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/priesthood?lang=eng

  

“First, priesthood is the power and authority of God. It has always existed and will continue to exist without end (see Alma 13:7–8; Doctrine and Covenants 84:17–18). Through the priesthood, God created and governs the heavens and the earth. Through this power, He exalts His obedient children, bringing to pass “the immortality and eternal life of man” (Moses 1:39; see also Doctrine and Covenants 84:35–38).

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/priesthood?lang=eng

  

“Second, in mortality, priesthood is the power and authority that God gives to man to act in all things necessary for the salvation of God’s children. The blessings of the priesthood are available to all who receive the gospel (“Priesthood Authority,” Handbook 2, Administering the Church).”

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/priesthood?lang=eng

  

  

“Priesthood Authority”

“Priesthood authority is the authorization to represent God and act in His name. In the Church, all priesthood authority is exercised under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys.”

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/3-priesthood-principles?lang=eng#title_number7

  

All Males

“He has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple.”

President Kimball 1978. Official Declaration 2.

  

“Worthy male Church members receive priesthood authority through priesthood conferral and ordination to priesthood offices. All Church members can exercise delegated authority as they are set apart or assigned to assist in accomplishing God’s work. Members are accountable to God and to those He has appointed to preside for how they exercise His authority (see 3.4.4).”

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/3-priesthood-principles?lang=eng#title_number7

  

So it has to do with keys, but again, why can’t women have those keys?

  

“Now this same priesthood which was in the beginning shall be in the end of the world also.” - Gen. 6:7

  

““qualifying for exaltation is not a matter of asserting rights but a matter of fulfilling responsibilities.”” - Dallin H Oaks

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/inspiration/how-can-women-receive-gods-priesthood-power-and-authority?lang=eng

  

“Essentially, my service mission leader paraphrased President Oaks when he said: “We are not accustomed to speaking of women having the authority of the priesthood in their Church callings, but what other authority can it be? When a woman—young or old—is set apart to preach the gospel as a full-time missionary, she is given priesthood authority to perform a priesthood function. The same is true when a woman is set apart to function as an officer or teacher in a Church organization under the direction of one who holds the keys of the priesthood.” “

Power vs. Authority

“Priesthood holders have been authorized to represent God and act in His name to perform ordinances and blessings. This is priesthood authority. Priesthood power, on the other hand, is different. Priesthood power is the power by which God blesses His sons and daughters—His power extends to all members of His Church, both women and men, as they make and keep their covenants with Him.”

Priesthood Authority

Priesthood authority is the authorization to represent God and act in His name. In the Church, all priesthood authority is exercised under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys.

Worthy male Church members receive priesthood authority through priesthood conferral and ordination to priesthood offices. All Church members can exercise delegated authority as they are set apart or assigned to assist in accomplishing God’s work. Members are accountable to God and to those He has appointed to preside for how they exercise His authority (see 3.4.4).

Setting Apart

“When men and women are set apart under the direction of those who hold priesthood keys, they are given authority from God to act in that calling. When they are released from a calling, they no longer have the authority associated with it.

  

“Some callings are associated with offices and quorums of the priesthood. For example, a man who holds the Melchizedek Priesthood may be called as an elders quorum president. When he is set apart by the stake president, he is given priesthood keys, authority, and responsibility to direct the work of the elders quorum (see 3.4.1).

  

“Many other Church callings are not associated with priesthood offices and quorums. But all Church members who are set apart to serve are given divine authority and responsibility to act in their callings. For example:

  

“A woman who is called and set apart by the bishop as ward Relief Society president is given authority to direct the work of Relief Society in the ward.

  

“A man or woman who is called and set apart by a member of the bishopric as a Primary teacher is given authority to teach Primary children in the ward.

  

“All who are called and set apart serve under the direction of those who preside over them (see 3.4.1.2).”

Assignment

Presiding Church leaders can delegate authority by assignment. When men and women receive these assignments, they are given authority from God to act. For example:

* The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles delegate authority to Seventies who are assigned to administer areas and to preside at stake conferences.

* Mission presidents delegate authority to male and female missionaries who are assigned to lead and train other missionaries.

* Authority is delegated to Church members to serve as ministering brothers and ministering sisters. This occurs when they are assigned under the bishop’s direction by the elders quorum president or Relief Society president.

Authority that is delegated by assignment is limited to the specific responsibilities and duration of the assignment.

For more information about assignment through delegation, see 4.2.5.

There’s a keyword - preside.

Preside in Righteousness

The Lord revealed that “of necessity there are presidents, or presiding officers” in His Church (Doctrine and Covenants 107:21). Those who hold priesthood keys preside in their areas of responsibility, such as a quorum or ward.

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p30#title_number8

  

Other organizations in the Church, including the Relief Society, Young Women, Primary, and Sunday School, are also led by a presiding officer. These leaders are called, set apart, and given delegated authority by one who holds priesthood keys or someone he has authorized (see 3.4.3).

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p30#title_number8

  

Each presiding officer serves under the direction of a person who holds priesthood keys (see 3.4.1). This structure provides order and clear lines of responsibility and accountability in doing the Lord’s work.

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p30#title_number8

  

A presiding officer may delegate to another person a temporary assignment to preside. For example, if a Relief Society president will be absent from a Relief Society Sunday meeting, she would assign her first counselor to preside in the meeting. If the first counselor will also be absent, the president would assign her second counselor to preside.

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p30#title_number8

  

A leader who presides in a Church organization, meeting, or activity ensures that the Lord’s purposes are accomplished. In doing this, the leader follows gospel principles, Church policies, and the direction of the Holy Ghost.

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p30#title_number8

  

Those who preside follow the example of Jesus Christ in serving with gentleness, meekness, and pure love (see John 13:13–15). A calling or assignment to preside does not make the person who receives it more important or valued than others (see Doctrine and Covenants 84:109–10).

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p30#title_number8

  

If you have been called or assigned to preside, follow the Savior’s teaching that “whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your servant” (Matthew 20:27; see verses 26–28). Counsel with others and seek unity in understanding the Lord’s will and doing His work (see Doctrine and Covenants 41:2; see also 4.4 in this handbook).

https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/4-leadership-in-the-church-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng&id=title_number8-p30#title_number8

  

It is not appropriate to aspire to preside in any organization in the Lord’s Church (see Doctrine and Covenants 121:34–37). Rather, humbly and faithfully serve in the position to which you are called. Strive to accomplish the Lord’s work with an eye single to His glory (see Doctrine and Covenants 4:5). Trust that the Lord will give you opportunities to grow and to bless Heavenly Father’s children.

Conclusions, Subliminal messages with the questions

At a certain point, where does the questioning stop? There seems to be an implied sub-layer tone to the questions posed by people out on the internet and in “activist” group manifestos… “Why can’t women hold priesthood keys?” And the sub-layer tone seems to be “women are just as good as men, so what’s the deal?” Or another sub-layer tone, “men are part of an oppressive group of authoritarians and seek to rule everyone with an iron fist, that’s why they won’t let women hold priesthood keys.”

  

Well, would those same people question the divinity of Jesus Christ? Would they say, “oh Jesus Christ was a man, therefore he was inherently corrupt and part of an oppressive boys club mentality.” It seems those people still have a respect for Jesus Christ.

  

Women are serving in some of the highest roles of leadership we have in the Church. So it seems what they’re really saying is, why don’t we see any women acting as area seventies? Why don’t we see women acting as apostles or even the prophet?

  

It seems like a fair question. 

  

I mean, largely, the bulk of any calling and most especially callings where you preside, it’s all just service. Serving and supporting others.

  

I guess You are where the buck stops, authority, wise, and accountability wise, but… there’s such a huge push for operating in councils and receiving group revelation during those councils, that I really don’t know any righteous Priest and key, presiding officer, who is raining down, mayhem with an iron fist. Do you know? It just doesn’t exist.

  

I guess part of me wants church leaders to just say it. Say why. Clearly, and to simply say why women cannot hold priest of keys at the highest levels of our church. Maybe the reason I don’t say anything is because they don’t know the true reason. It’s all just speculation. I mean, if there was a readily taught logical explanation that most of the apostles and the prophet agreed on I’m sure they would state it. They’ve had ample opportunity to do so. But yet they haven’t and I think that is telling.
