"Corrupt judges seek to incite the people against Nephi" [Hel. 8 - Chapter Heading](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/8?id=study_summary1&lang=eng#study_summary1)

## Thoughts

Same thing today. We have a problem today with judges and not only judges but politicians doing exactly this. Stirring up the hearts of the people to anger instead of teaching The people how they can change it calmly they appeal to an angry emotional outburst on behalf of the people.

Is there anything worse than a corrupt judge? Literally their job is to decipher good and evil. If the they can’t, or rather won’t, society doesn’t stand a chance.
