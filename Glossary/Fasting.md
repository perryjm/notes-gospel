A law established by the Lord. "The Law of the Fast and Fast Offerings." A sacrifice performed voluntarily by members of the church, usually on the first Sunday of the month. It typically involves praying, going without food and drink for a 24-hour period (if physically able), giving a generous fast offering equal the the amount you would have paid for food, giving more if able.

Key benefits include growing closer to the Lord, increased spiritual strength, increased self-reliance, greater compassion, 

## Procedure
1. Begin and end with prayer.
2. Fast with a purpose (see [Matthew 17:18–21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/matt/17.18-21?lang=eng#p18); [Mosiah 27:22–23](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.22-23?lang=eng#p22); [Alma 5:45–46](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.45-46?lang=eng#p45); [28:4–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/28.4-6?lang=eng#p4); [Helaman 3:35](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/3.35?lang=eng#p35)).

4. Encourage your family members to fast within reason (see below quotes on nursing mothers, children, and over 24 hours).

But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy face; That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father, who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly."

- President Joseph F. Smith also counsels us to be wise in our fasting. “There is such a thing as overdoing. A man may fast and pray till he kills himself; and there isn’t any necessity for it; nor wisdom in it. … The Lord can hear a simple prayer, offered in faith, in half a dozen words, and he will recognize fasting that may not continue more than twenty-four hours, just as readily and as effectually as He will answer a prayer of a thousand words and fasting for a month. … The Lord will accept that which is enough, with a good deal more pleasure and satisfaction than that which is too much and unnecessary” (in Conference Report, Oct. 1912, 133–34).
 - Encourage your family members to fast, always following the wise counsel of President Joseph F. Smith: “Many are subject to weakness, others are delicate in health, and others have nursing babies; of such it should not be required to fast. Neither should parents compel their little children to fast” (Gospel Doctrine, p. 244).
