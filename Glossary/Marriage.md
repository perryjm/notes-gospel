The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles proclaim that “marriage between a man and a woman is ordained of God and that the family is central to the Creator’s plan for the eternal destiny of His children.”1When a man and woman are married in the temple, their family can be together forever. This is a common goal of Latter-day Saints. -[gospel-topics](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/marriage?lang=eng)
