"The Holy Ghost is the third member of the Godhead. He is a personage of spirit, without a body of flesh and bones. He is often referred to as the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of the Lord, or the Comforter." [See Holy Ghost](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/gospel-topics/holy-ghost)

## Roles
- Guide us in our decisions as we strive to stay on the path leading to eternal life.
- Protects us from physical and spiritual danger
- Grant gifts of the spirit for our benefit and benefit of those we love and serve ([D&C46:9-11](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/46.9-11?lang=eng#p9))
- Comforts us ([John 14:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.26?lang=eng#p26)). As the soothing voice of a loving parent can quiet a crying child, the whisperings of the Spirit can calm our fears, hush the nagging worries of our life, and comfort us when we grieve.
- The Holy Ghost can fill us “with hope and perfect love” and “teach [us] the peaceable things of the kingdom” ([Moroni 8:26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/8.26?lang=eng#p26); [Doctrine and Covenants 36:2](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/36.2?lang=eng#p2)).
- Through His power, we are sanctified as we repent, receive the ordinances of baptism and confirmation, and remain true to our covenants (see [Mosiah 5:1–6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/5.1-6?lang=eng#p1); [3 Nephi 27:20](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27.20?lang=eng#p20); [Moses 6:64–68](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/6.64-68?lang=eng#p64)).
- He is the Holy Spirit of Promise (see [Ephesians 1:13](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/eph/1.13?lang=eng#p13); [Doctrine and Covenants 132:7, 18–19, 26](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.7,18-19,26?lang=eng#p7)). In this capacity, He confirms that the priesthood ordinances we have received and the covenants we have made are acceptable to God. This approval depends on our continued faithfulness.
- After receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, a person has the right to the constant companionship of that member of the Godhead if he or she keeps the commandments.


## Testify
2011-07-13
I have the ability to receive knowledge and testimony through the power of the Holy Ghost. I feel the power of His witness to me frequently pertaining to the truth and validity of something I'm saying, reading, listening to, or watching, or thinking. 

I greatly appreciate this gift from God. I appreciate the influence of the Holy Ghost in my life up till now, and hope that I can remain worthy to stand in Holy Places and receive more council and guidance.
