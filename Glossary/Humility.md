#humility  

Humility is willingness to do whatever the Lord asks you to do *when* he asks you to do it. It is willingness to honestly declare your current state of affairs regardless of your station and how that honesty may affect your station. It is a necessary component to receiving revelation in all forms. Humility allows for the seeking of advice and correction. The antidote for pride is humility—meekness, submissiveness. It is the broken heart and contrite spirit.

## Beware of Pride
[Beware of Pride](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1989/04/beware-of-pride?lang=eng) by President Benson.

"The central feature of pride is enmity—enmity toward God and enmity toward our fellowmen. _Enmity_ means “hatred toward, hostility to, or a state of opposition.” It is the power by which Satan wishes to reign over us.

"Pride is essentially competitive in nature. We pit our will against God’s. When we direct our pride toward God, it is in the spirit of “my will and not thine be done.” As Paul said, they “seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ’s.” ([Philip. 2:21](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/nt/philip/2.21?lang=eng#p21).)

"Our will in competition to God’s will allows desires, appetites, and passions to go unbridled. (See [Alma 38:12](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/38.12?lang=eng#p12); [3 Ne. 12:30](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.30?lang=eng#p30).)

"The proud cannot accept the authority of God giving direction to their lives. (See [Hel. 12:6](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.6?lang=eng#p6).) They pit their perceptions of truth against God’s great knowledge, their abilities versus God’s priesthood power, their accomplishments against His mighty works."

## My Humility 2011-08-21  
I will go. I will do. Whatever the Lord wants me to do. I will jump in a canoe and row into the storm. I will get on a bus and ride to a different country. I will stop anything that I am doing to teach my son or daughter how to tie their shoes.   
  
I will go to five rest homes every Sunday from now until the day I die to bring happiness, joy, and the sacrament and hymns to the elderly. I will visit the poor, the sick, the lonely in heart until I become sick, poor, and needy in heart.  
  
I commit here and now to always remember the things I have written here. I commit here and now, that I will serve *anyone*. It does not matter, whomever and however the Lord MY GOD, My Savior, and My Redeemer directs me.
