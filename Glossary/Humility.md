Willingness to do whatever the Lord asks you to do *when* he asks you to do it.

## My Humility 2011-08-21
I will go. I will do. Whatever the Lord wants me to do. I will jump in a canoe and row into the storm. I will get on a bus and ride to a different country. I will stop anything that I am doing to teach my son or daughter how to tie their shoes. 

I will go to five rest homes every Sunday from now until the day I die to bring happiness, joy, and the sacrament and hymns to the elderly. I will visit the poor, the sick, the lonely in heart until I become sick, poor, and needy in heart.

I commit here and now to always remember the things I have written here. I commit here and now, that I will serve *anyone*. It does not matter, whomever and however the Lord MY GOD, My Savior, and My Redeemer directs me.
