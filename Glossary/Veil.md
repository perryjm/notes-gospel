- This earth is the place where a third part of the hosts of heaven are;
- Leaving the presence of God, there seems to be a veil there. And a veil to get back into the presence of God;
- Itâ€™s in the temple narrative now, the Veil is like Christ, in that we have to go through him to get to the father. He is the way. He is our advocate with the Father;
- Generally, as church members, we believe in receiving help from beyond the veil.
