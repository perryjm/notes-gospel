# Tupperware
#symbol 

Earlier I thought of this analogy to better describe my frustration with symbols. Then the Lord taught me, "what you just thought of was a symbol, which helped you better understand your own feelings." And I was like, "Oh!"

Symbols are a simplification. You have to first understand the doctrine to then be able to understand the symbol. But when you see the symbol, it just seems like an over-simplification of the doctrine. So then what's the point? 

Symbology is like a man cooking spaghetti, and he cooks too much, then he must fit it all into a food-storage container. But the container quickly fills to capacity, and he is left still with excess spaghetti. What does he do?

While that's frustrating, it's necessary for preserving knowledge. We cannot learn all at once.

The man must place his tupperware in the refrigerator for food-preservation and safe-keeping and later enjoyment. The tupperware and refrigerator keep the food fresh. 

So it is with symbols. You read something in the scriptures, you read and read, but you don't remember *everything* you read. Then you notice a symbol "out in the wild." Your understanding deepens, much of what you read *clicks* and this is the equivalent of the spaghetti being placed in the food-storage container. Now your knowledge and study are wrapped up and associated (rather deeply) with that symbol. And when it comes time to revisit that gospel principle or spiritual truth or doctrine, the symbol comes to mind, and out comes the knowledge and understanding from that previous study too. When you see it again, all those thoughts you had are unlocked once again, quickly and efficiently. And the eyes of your understanding are opened once again, just like when you first saw the symbol. Then, your understanding has a new chance to deepen and expand.
