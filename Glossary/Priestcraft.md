# Priestcraft
Seeking to profit or commercialize the word of God, or the gospel.

Based on Book of Mormon passages, priestcraft is as small as insisting that priests get paid, and as big as hoodwinking entire nations and leading them astray.

## Rant on Hierarchy of Authoritative Sources, and Discernment
I think the biggest frustration for me comes from seeing others display a failure to appropriately discern between different sources of information. 

For example, someone might read a book from the brother of an apostle, because it’s sold at Deseret book. And in that book he says the root cause of being homosexual is purely genetics. Now, the tendency when reading material published or sold by Deseret book is to trust it, and believe it. Some even go so far as to assume that the church’s seal is approval is upon it. 

I may point out to this person that Dallin h oaks gave a talk in 1995 about same gender attraction where he cites several studies clearly identifying only a small percentage of homosexuals actually have a genetic predisposition to homosexuality.

We may undergo a bit of a debate about who is right. What is aggravating to me, is this brother of an apostle carry’s no authority, especially when compared to an actual apostle. The same is true the world over, byu professors, institute teachers, etc.

People who are unable to sort through this authority hierarchy and match what they’re reading with the appropriate weight, really annoy me and I think are practicing a form of priestcraft. 

If you find things that disagree, always err on the side with more general authority.
