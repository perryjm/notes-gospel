# Family Tree
#symbol 

You can’t look at a tree and suddenly understand the plan of salvation, but you might notice the branches of a tree and see that it’s *like* a pedigree chart and have a deeper understanding of the plan of salvation. The root of the tree with the seed is God.

See, you had to understand the doctrine first, and then notice the symbology present in a tree. But now that you see the symbol of the tree, your understanding of the doctrine can grow because you notice all the variability in a tree and how it grows and how its branches seemingly randomly grow and sprout and there are knots here and angles there, a LOT like how our actual families grow here on earth. 

Then, you take that richer understanding of families you gained from the symbol back to the scriptures and notice new connections in the scriptures. Like Lehi's family, with Nephi and Sam being more righteous than Laman and Lemuel. But yet still part of the family and still having an allegiance to one another. Or Jacob and Esau and the disagreement that happened between them and their mothers, and yet, their getting along in the end. Also, the contrast of their attitudes and their place in their respective family trees. It helps. 

When you zoom into the bark on tree, it may seem ugly, but when you zoom out, who can say a whole tree, in any form, is ugly? Or a whole forest of trees. Are they not beautiful? So it is with the family of God.

So that's the **richness** people are talking about with symbols.
