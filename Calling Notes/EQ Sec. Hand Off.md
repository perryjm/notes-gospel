Not sure why, but I'm hearing my brain run social simulations of a new EQ presidency meeting for the first time and deciding on how to be organized. I think I might say something like this….

  

"I'm a firm believer that every person here is a working professional and has had to organize and manage and adapt their own personal workflow to fit their needs up until now. So I don't think we need to invent new ways of doing things, we just need to do things. 

  

"For some, being in this presidency means having more meetings and appointments than you are now used to, so that may be new you might have to adapt a little. For others there may be more 'TODO' items associated with church stuff now than you've ever been accustomed to. That's ok. We can all adapt our workflows a little bit. We gotta be patient with each other and flexible and forgiving as we all adjust a little bit for the sake of getting on the same page, literally and figuratively.

  

"I don't think the presidency is a place to SELL things to each other. You know what I mean? We don't need to sell each other on our ideas, we just need to present information and let the Lord guide us through the Spirit. What is an awesome new app for one person is a pain-in-the-neck new thing to learn for another person. I think in the end what really matters is doing what the Lord asks us to do, and that's usually not 'go download C app' it's usually 'go talk with person A or B.'

  

"President, do you mind if we just go around the room and ask each presidency member individually how they organize their schedule and TODO's?

  

"…

  

"For me, I like to keep it simple. Usually info flows in from email or text message, and I read it, and as I read it, I filter out most everything else, and zero in on things that pertain to me and what I need to do, and then I add those things to my to do list. I use Siri A LOT and I just trigger Siri and say "remind me to ask Bart Simpson how he's doing this Thursday night at 7pm" and Siri adds that to the reminders app. and I've tailored my phone to cut out almost all notifications except those from my reminder and calendar apps (and other communication-only apps like phone and messages, slack, discord, marco polo etc. I like to keep it simple"
