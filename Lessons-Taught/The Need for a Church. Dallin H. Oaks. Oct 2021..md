1. “The church is true, now everybody go home” [walk away]

    1. Just kidding! What if that happened? Some of you were like “Woo-hoo!” And others of you probably felt a little let down. Why?

2. “In church, we associate with wonderful people striving to serve God. This reminds us that we are not alone in our religious activities. We all need associations with others, and church associations are some of the best we can experience, for us and our companions and children. Without those associations, especially between children and faithful parents, research shows increasing difficulty for parents to raise children in their faith.” -Elder Oaks. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

    1. [5 min] How does being at church kindle your faith and how can you kindle the faith of others?

3. “In church we are taught how to apply religious principles. We learn from one another. A persuasive example is more powerful than a sermon. We are strengthened by associating with others of like minds.” -Elder Oaks. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

    1. [5 min] What are some lessons you have learned from the example of others at church, rather than the sermon of others?

    2. [5 min] What is it that the Holy Ghost taught you as you studied the scriptures this week?

4. “Some say that attending church meetings is not helping them. Some say, ‘I didn’t learn anything today’ or ‘no one was friendly to me’ or ‘I was offended.’ Personal disappointments should never keep us from the doctrine of Christ, who taught us to serve, not to be served.” -Elder Oaks. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

    1. [5 min] Have you had times in your life when you have felt similar frustration towards church attendance? What helped you pull through, why are you here today?

5. “Years ago, I changed my attitude about going to church. No longer do I go to church for my sake, but to think of others. I make a point of saying hello to people who sit alone, to welcome visitors, to volunteer for an assignment. In short, I go to church each week with the intent of being active, not passive, and making a positive difference in peoples lives.” -Elder Oaks quoting a member. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

    1. [5 min] Have you tried to follow this member’s example?

        1. This inspired me when I first heard it in conference. 

        2. With a 1 year old, ask myself ‘Why am I even going to church? All we do is walk the halls’ 

        3. the sacrament. To serve others. To be active not passive.

6. “We do not go to Sabbath meetings to be entertained or even solely to be instructed. We go to worship the Lord. It is an individual responsibility. If the service is a failure to you, you have failed. No one can worship for you; you must do your own waiting upon the Lord.” - President Spencer W Kimball. Ensign Jan 1978. Emphasis Added.

    1. Story about mission, Christmas season in Richmond Hill. bus stop 20 year old guy

    2. Invite him to worship with us 

    3. “Have you ever been praised? Do you think god wants that constantly? To have people bowing down and worshipping him?”

        1. [5 min] Worship means to express ones devotion, respect, and honor to God... What are some ways you can better express your respect, honor, and devotion to God when you are attending church?

  

  

## SPLIT INTO GROUPS [15 min]

1. “The restored church… helps us grow spiritually. Growth means change. In spiritual terms this means repenting and seeking to draw nearer to the Lord. In the restored church we have doctrine, procedures, and inspired helpers that assist us to repent.” -Elder Oaks. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

2. “The First Presidency has said: “Inspirational music is an essential part of our church meetings. The hymns invite the Spirit of the Lord, create a feeling of reverence, unify us as members, and provide a way for us to offer praises to the Lord. “Some of the greatest sermons are preached by the singing of hymns. Hymns move us to repentance and good works, build testimony and faith, comfort the weary, console the mourning, and inspire us to endure to the end” (Hymns, 1985, p. ix). The singing of hymns is one of the best ways to put ourselves in tune with the Spirit of the Lord. I wonder if we are making enough use of this heaven-sent resource in our meetings, in our classes, and in our homes… Sacred music has a unique capacity to communicate our feelings of love for the Lord. This kind of communication is a wonderful aid to our worship. Many have difficulty expressing worshipful feelings in words, but all can join in communicating such feelings through the inspired words of our hymns.” - Elder Oaks. Oct 1994. Worship through Music

3. “[Continuing from Grace to Grace until we receive a fullness] requires more than simply being nice or feeling spiritual. It requires faith in Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism of water and of the Spirit, and enduring in faith to the end. One cannot fully achieve this in isolation, so a major reason the Lord has a church is to create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the “strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life.” - Elder Christofferson. Oct 2015. Why the church

4. “Latter day Saints are renowned for their ability to lead and unite in cooperative efforts. That tradition originated with our courageous pioneers who colonized the intermountain west and established our valued tradition of unselfish cooperation for the common good.” -Elder Oaks. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

  

  

## BEAR TESTIMONY [1 min]

  

## CLOSING ACTIVITY [1 min]

1. As a result of what you’ve heard felt and thought today, pull out your phone, make yourself a reminder for next Saturday evening or Sunday morning of something you’d like to do differently next Sunday to have a better experience at church.

  

  

## OTHER QUOTES

1. “In the geographic organization of our local wards, we associate and work with persons we might not otherwise have chosen, persons who teach us and test us. In addition to helping us learn spiritual qualities like love, compassion, forgiveness, and patience, this gives us the opportunity to learn how to work with persons of very different backgrounds and preferences.” -Elder Oaks. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

2. “Most humanitarian and charitable efforts need to be accomplished by pooling and managing individual resources on a large scale. The restored church does this with its enormous humanitarian efforts worldwide. These include distributing educational and medical supplies, feeding the hungry, caring for refugees, helping to reverse the effects of addictions, and a host of others. Our church members are renowned for their helping hands projects in natural disasters. Church membership allows us to be part of such large scale efforts. Members also pay fast offerings to help the poor in their own midst.” -Elder Oaks. Oct 2021. The Need for a Church

3. “We cannot wish our way into the presence of God. We are to obey the laws upon which that blessing is predicated. One of those laws is to worship in church each Sabbath day. Our worship and application of eternal principles draw us closer to God and magnify our capacity to love.” - President Russell M Nelson

4. “If one believes that all roads lead to heaven or that there are no particular requirements for salvation, he or she will see no need for proclaiming the gospel or for ordinances and covenants in redeeming either the living or the dead. But we speak not just of immortality but also of eternal life, and for that the gospel path and gospel covenants are essential. And the Savior needs a church to make them available to all of God’s children﻿—both the living and the dead.” - Elder Christofferson. Oct 2015. Why the church

5. “If a man worships a cow or a crocodile, he can gain any reward that cows and crocodiles happen to be passing out this season. If he worships the laws of the universe or the forces of nature, no doubt the earth will continue to spin, the sun to shine, and the rains to fall on the just and on the unjust. But if he worships the true and living God, in spirit and in truth, then God Almighty will pour out his Spirit upon him, and he will have power to raise the dead, move mountains, entertain angels, and walk in celestial streets. “ -Bruce R. McConkie. Oct 1971. How to Worship

6. “In time and by degrees, we receive His gracious strength and direction—perhaps leading us to frequent the temple or to study more deeply the Savior’s Atonement or to consult with a friend, a bishop, a professional counselor, or even a doctor. The healing of our heart begins when we submit to and worship God. True worship begins when our hearts are right before the Father and the Son. What is our heart condition today? Paradoxically, in order to have a healed and faithful heart, we must first allow it to break before the Lord. “Ye shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit,” the Lord declares. The result of sacrificing our heart, or our will, to the Lord is that we receive the spiritual guidance we need. - Neill F. Marriott. Oct 2015. Yielding Our Hearts to God
