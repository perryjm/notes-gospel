“Daily Restoration” by Uchtdorf. Oct. 2021

First Talk on Sunday Morning

  

## Questions

- Elder Uchtdorf says, “…it is human nature: without reliable landmarks, we drift off course.” What landmarks are in your life? How do you avoid drifting off course?

- Elder Uchtdorf also says a small rudder can steer a large ship. And that little acts can steer us back on course. What little acts steer you back on course towards the Savior?

  

## My landmarks

* My Dad. Walking the path of life on up ahead of me. 

* The scriptures, stories in them. Do I feel like reading them today? If not, Red flag.

* Prayer. Do I feel like praying? If not, red flag.

  

  

## Interesting quotes

- Why do we have such a hard time walking in a straight line? Some researchers hypothesize that small, seemingly insignificant deviations in terrain make the difference. Others have pointed to the fact that we all have one leg that is slightly stronger than the other. “More likely,” however, we struggle to walk straight ahead “[because] of increasing uncertainty about where straight ahead is.”

- This is true for individuals. It is also true for societies and nations. The scriptures are filled with examples. The book of Judges records that after Joshua died, “there arose another generation … which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.”

- Sometimes this falling away takes generations. Sometimes it happens in a matter of years or even months. But we are all susceptible. No matter how strong our spiritual experiences have been in the past, as human beings we tend to wander. That has been the pattern from the days of Adam until now.

- As our days go, so go our lives. One author put it this way: “A day is like a whole life. You start out doing one thing, but end up doing something else, plan to run an errand, but never get there. … And at the end of your life, your whole existence has that same haphazard quality, too. Your whole life has the same shape as a single day.” [Jurassic Park, Michael Crichton] Do you want to change the shape of your life? Change the shape of your day. Do you want to change your day? Change this hour. Change what you think, feel, and do at this very moment.

- And what are these landmarks? Surely they include daily prayer and pondering the scriptures and using inspired tools like Come, Follow Me. Each day, we can approach the throne of God in humility and honesty. We can ponder our actions and review the moments of our day—considering our will and desires in light of His. If we have drifted, we plead with God to restore us, and we commit to do better.

- When darkness creeps into our lives, as it often does, our daily restoration opens our hearts to heavenly light, which illuminates our souls, chasing away shadows, fears, and doubts.
