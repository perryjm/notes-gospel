# Utah Area Ministering

Ryan: Here's the talk I think would be awesome to discuss. Focus on ministering in higher and holier ways. I hope the Quorum can see the simpleness that ministering really is. 

Also here's some questions I thought be helpful. 

- What does ministering mean to you?
- What influence has someone played in your life to help you be a better minister?
- What is your favorite story of Christ ministering?
- how can we be better at showing compassion to those we minister to?
