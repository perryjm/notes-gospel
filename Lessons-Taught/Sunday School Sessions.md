## 2024-01-07 Book of Mormon Title Page
What are the three main purposes of the Book of Mormon?
1. to show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers; 
2. that they \[the remnant\] may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever— 
3. to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that JESUS is the CHRIST, the ETERNAL GOD, manifesting himself unto all nations
