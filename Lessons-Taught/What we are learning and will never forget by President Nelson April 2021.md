Questions to class

1. Adversity is a great teacher. What have you learned in the past two years that you always want to remember?

2. How do you think it affected your family members to see you- their father, grandfather, husband, son, or brother- administer this holy ordinance [the sacrament]? What will you do to retain that sacred feeling in your family?

3. A common trial has the potential to unite Gods children as never before… Has this shared trial drawn you closer to your neighbors- to your brothers and sisters across the street and around the world?

4. My brethren … of the elders quorum, expand your vision of why we have quorums. How does the Lord wish you would use your quorum to accomplish his work- now?… quorums are in a unique position to accelerate the gathering of Israel on both sides of the veil.

  

Discussion

Quotes

(1) “One of the holiest of places on earth is the home- yes, even your home.”(Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

(2) “You and your family have received priesthood ordinances. It is in the ordinances of the priesthood that the power of godliness is manifest. (DC 84:20) That power is available to you and your family in your own home as you keep the covenants you have made.”(Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

(3) “Between now and the time the lord comes again, we all need our homes to be places of serenity and security.”(Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

(4) “Present restrictions on gathering will eventually end. However, your commitment to make your home your primary sanctuary of faith should never end.” (Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

Question: What is President Nelson talking about here? Our Homes? A Sanctuary of Faith? Why do we even need that?

- “As faith and holiness decrease in this fallen world, your need for holy places will increase.”(Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget)

- “I urge you to continue to make your home a truly holy place “and be not moved” from that essential goal.” (DC 87:8) (Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget)

- Define Sanctuary: a consecrated place. the ancient Hebrew temple at Jerusalem or its holy of holies. a place of refuge and protection. the immunity from law attached to a sanctuary.

  

(5) “You May feel that there is still more you need to do to make your home truly a sanctuary of faith. If so, please do it! …counsel with your wife as your equal partner in this crucial work.”

  

Question: Hypothetically speaking, What are some ways that one could make their home a better sanctuary of faith?

- Dedicate your home (priesthood ordinance)

- Refrain from consuming media that is untoward (no brushing your teeth in the morning to metal music) “select only media that uplifts you” (standards for youth - entertainment and media)

- Decorate in a way that invites the spirit. (No obscene movie posters) Ask yourself, “Would I feel comfortable with my appearance if I were in the Lord’s presence?”

- Dress and apparel- Ask yourself, “Would I feel comfortable with my appearance if I were in the Lord’s presence?” (Standards for Youth- Dress and Appearance)

- Language. “If you have developed the habit of using language that is not in keeping with these standards—such as swearing, mocking, gossiping, or speaking in anger to others﻿—you can change. Pray for help. Ask your family and friends to support you in your desire to use good language.” (Standards for Youth- Language)

- You need to protect your family spiritually. “By divine design, fathers are to preside over their families in love and righteousness and are responsible to provide the necessities of life and protection for their families.” (The family a proclamation to the world. 7th P)

  

  

(6) “Lesson 2: We need each other. God wants us to work together and help each other. That’s why He sends us to earth in families and organizes us into wards and stakes. That is why he asks us to serve and minister to each other.” (Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

(7) “If you know of anyone who is alone, reach out- even if you feel alone too! You do not need a reason or a message or business to transact. Just say hello and show your love [by serving]. Technology can help you. Pandemic or not, each precious child of God needs to know that he or she is not alone!” (Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

Question: When people feel alone, what do they do to stop feeling way? 

  

And how can you help them in that process?

  

  

(9) “Lesson 4: We Hear Jesus Christ Better When We Are Still. We live in a time prophesied long ago, when “all things shall be in commotion; and surely, men’s hearts shall fail them; for fear shall come upon all people.” That was true before the pandemic, and it will be true after. Commotion in the world will continue to increase.”(Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

(10) “In contrast, the voice of the Lord is not “a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but … it [is] a still voice of perfect mildness, [like] a whisper, and it [pierces] even to the very soul.” In order to hear this still voice, you too must be still!” [Helaman 5:30, 1 kings 19:12, 3 Nephi 11:3] (Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

(11) Quiet time is sacred time- time that will facilitate personal revelation and instill peace… [we may choose to fill that time with the noise and commotion of the world. Or we can use our time to hear the voice of the Lord whispering His guidance, comfort, and peace.]” (Pres. Nelson. April 2021. What we are learning and will never forget.)

  

Question: How do you get quiet time? And why is it valuable to you?

- “Solitude is freedom from input from other minds.” You need it to hear the voice of the lord, to see the bigger picture, to synthesize new ideas, and to be proactive instead of reactive. 

- “Helaman 5:30 And it came to pass when they heard this voice, and beheld that it was not a voice of thunder, neither was it a voice of a great tumultuous noise, but behold, it was a still voice of perfect mildness, as if it had been a whisper, and it did pierce even to the very soul-“ (Helaman 5:30)

- “And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it” (Isaiah 30:21)
