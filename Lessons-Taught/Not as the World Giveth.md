* “…the instruments we need to create a brighter day and grow an economy of genuine goodness in society are abundantly provided for in the gospel of Jesus Christ.” -Elder Holland Not as the world giveth

* “Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.” -John 14:1

* “Brothers and sisters, we do see too much conflict, anger, and general incivility around us.” -Elder Holland not as the world giveth 2021

* “One of the obvious reasons for this [staggering number of verses in the Book of Mormon devoted to conflict of one kind or another] is that inasmuch as the Book of Mormon was written for a latter-day audience, these authors (who experienced so much of war themselves) prophetically warn us that violence and conflict will be a signature characteristic of relationships in the last days.” - elder Holland not as the world giveth 2021

* “…in this worldwide congregation today are many who struggle with any number of challenges—physical or emotional, social or financial, or a dozen other kinds of trouble. But many of these we are not strong enough to address in and of ourselves, for the help and peace we need is not the kind “the world giveth.” No, for the truly difficult problems we need what the scriptures call “the powers of heaven,” and to access these powers we must live by what these same scriptures call “principles of righteousness.” Now, understanding that connection between principle and power is the one lesson the human family never seems able to learn, so says the God of heaven and earth!” -Elder Holland Not as the world giveth 2021. John 14:27. DC 121:36. DC 121:35.
