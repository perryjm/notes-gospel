# Make time for the lord
Make Time for the Lord 

By President Nelson [Oct 2021]

## The Talk

  

P3 - “The pandemic has demonstrated how quickly life can change, at times from circumstances beyond our control. However, there are many things we can control. We set our own priorities and determine how we use our energy, time, and means. We decide how we will treat each other. We choose those to whom we will turn for truth and guidance.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

P4 - “The voices and pressures of the world are engaging and numerous. But too many voices are deceptive, seductive, and can pull us off the covenant path. To avoid the inevitable heartbreak that follows, I plead with you today to counter the lure of the world by making time for the Lord in your life—each and every day.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“If most of the information you get comes from social or other media, your ability to hear the whisperings of the Spirit will be diminished.“ — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“If you are not also seeking the Lord through daily prayer and gospel study, you leave yourself vulnerable to philosophies that may be intriguing but are not true.“ — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“Even Saints who are otherwise faithful can be derailed by the steady beat of Babylon’s band.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“My brothers and sisters, I plead with you to make time for the Lord! Make your own spiritual foundation firm and able to stand the test of time by doing those things that allow the Holy Ghost to be with you always.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“Nothing invites the Spirit more than fixing your focus on Jesus Christ. Talk of Christ, rejoice in Christ, feast upon the words of Christ, and press forward with steadfastness in Christ.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“Make your Sabbath a delight as you worship Him, partake of the sacrament, and keep His day holy.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“…Please make time for the Lord in His holy house. Nothing will strengthen your spiritual foundation like temple service and temple worship.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

“He will lead and guide you in your personal life if you will make time for Him in your life—each and every day.” — Make Time For the Lord. President Nelson. Oct 2021.

  

  

## Questions

 • What does he mean by “make time for the lord each and every day?” He says it like three times. What is he talking about? [ No matter your schedule, force yourself to study and pray daily]

 • What are we supposed to do? What? [ Daily prayer, daily scripture study, Sabbath Day observance, Temple service, fix focus on Jesus Christ, do the things that allow Holy Ghost to be with us always]

 • Why do these things? [ Stay planted in the gospel, to survive spiritually in coming days, to be guided by the Voice of the Lord, ]

 • Why daily? Daily prayer and daily scripture study? [ Spirit is a muscle too, work and stretch it every day, by small and simple things are great things brought to pass]

 • How can we limit the voices of the world and lessen the input of deceptive seductive voices that pull us off the covenant path? [ Learn to discern between right and wrong, put correct ideas into circulation, ]

 • What sayings recently have had the potential to derail you if you weren’t being watchful? [ Youtube ad teaching why you shouldn’t pray about the Book of Mormon, ]

 • How do you individually make time for the Lord? [ before work and before the kids wake up]

 • How can you get more spiritual power or focus out of your gospel study? 

 • [ 12:25pm ] I invite you to take the last five minutes of class, and do a silent inventory. “How is my study honestly going?” “How can it be improved?” “What is my plan to start praying and studying the gospel every day like the prophet wants?” “With whom will I discuss the things I learn?” “When?” “How long will I study?” “How will I know if the study was up to par? Quality metric.” “How will I track and be accountable for daily prayer and daily gospel study?”

  

## Richard G. Scott

“Don’t yield to Satan’s lie that you don’t have time to study the scriptures. Choose to take time to study them. Feasting on the word of God each day is more important than sleep, school, work, television shows, video games, or social media. You may need to reorganize your priorities to provide time for the study of the word of God. If so, do it!” — Elder Richard G. Scott. Make the Exercise of Faith Your First Priority. 2014.

## Preach My Gospel; Chapter 2;

Apply and Live What You Learn

 • “Liken” what you learn to yourself (see 1 Nephi 19:23).

 • Set goals to live what you are learning.

 • Substitute your name in a verse of scripture to personalize it.

 • Ask yourself, “How should I change as a result of what I have learned?” Set appropriate goals.

  

  

## Preach My Gospel; Chapter 2;

Search, Ponder, and Remember

 • Be physically and mentally alert as you study.

 • Study at a desk or table where you can write (not lying down or sitting on your bed), and organize your study materials.

 • Pray and ask for understanding.

 • Study by topic.

 • Ask yourself, “What is the author saying? What is the central message? How does this apply to me? How might this help my family?”

 • Visualize what you are studying. For example, imagine what it was like for Ammon to stand before the Lamanite king.

 • Study the words of the living prophets (in the Gospel Library and other approved resources).

 • Write in your study journal questions you have, and use the scriptures, words of latter-day prophets, and other study resources to find answers.

 • A single verse of scripture may contain several ideas. Underline and mark words or phrases so that you distinguish between ideas in a single verse.

 • Share what you learn with your family. You can learn much by explaining a doctrine or principle to another person.

 • Mark your scriptures and make notes in them. In the margins write scripture references that clarify the passages you are studying.

 • Memorize scripture passages that explain and support the principles of the gospel.

  

## Use Study Resources

 • Use the study aids in the LDS edition of the scriptures (Topical Guide, Bible Dictionary, Joseph Smith Translation, index to the triple combination, chapter headings, footnotes, and maps).

 • Use the missionary lessons and other approved Church resources such as Gospel Library, Gospel Topics, and Gospel Topics essays.

 • Review chapter headings in the scriptures. This review will give you ideas about what to look for in the chapter.

 • Use your study journal to record and organize what you are learning. Frequently review the thoughts you have recorded. Organize your journal so that you can easily recall what you have learned.

  

## See the Big Picture

 • Get an overview, either by reading the book, chapter, or passage quickly or by reviewing headings. Seek to understand the context and background.

 • Try writing the main idea of the passage in a sentence or short paragraph.

 • Use the Bible and Church history maps to learn geography, distances, climate, and terrain.

 • Review the sequence of events and the culture. Read the historical information in the Bible Dictionary and the chapter and section summaries.

  

  

## Explore the Details

 • Look for key words and make sure you understand what they mean. Use the footnotes, digital resources in Gospel Library, the Guide to the Scriptures, the Bible Dictionary, or another dictionary for definitions. Examine surrounding words or phrases for clues to what the key words mean.

 • Look for connecting words, such as therefore, and again, thus, wherefore, and others. Then see how the preceding and following passages relate to each other.

 • Use the Topical Guide or Guide to the Scriptures to see how the same word is used in other contexts or how other prophets use the same word.

 • Look for unfamiliar words or phrases and make sure you understand them.

## Other Stuff

  

Some examples include:

President Thomas S. Monson said: “As we read and ponder the scriptures, we will experience the sweet whisperings of the Spirit to our souls. We can find answers to our questions. We learn of the blessings which come through keeping God’s commandments. We gain a sure testimony of our Heavenly Father and our Savior, Jesus Christ, and of Their love for us. When scripture study is combined with our prayers, we can of a certainty know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true. … As we remember prayer and take time to turn to the scriptures, our lives will be infinitely more blessed and our burdens will be made lighter” (“We Never Walk Alone,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2013, 122).

  

  

President Gordon B. Hinckley said: “Without reservation I promise you that if each of you will observe this simple program, regardless of how many times you previously may have read the Book of Mormon, there will come into your lives and into your homes an added measure of the Spirit of the Lord, a strengthened resolution to walk in obedience to His commandments, and a stronger testimony of the living reality of the Son of God” (“A Testimony Vibrant and True,” Ensign or Liahona, Aug. 2005, 6).

  

President Howard W. Hunter said: “Families are greatly blessed when wise fathers and mothers bring their children about them, read from the pages of the scriptural library together, and then discuss freely the beautiful stories and thoughts according to the understanding of all. Often youth and little ones have amazing insight into and appreciation for the basic literature of religion” (“Reading the Scriptures,” Ensign, Nov. 1979, 64).

  

President Ezra Taft Benson said: “Often we spend great effort in trying to increase the activity levels in our stakes. We work diligently to raise the percentages of those attending sacrament meetings. We labor to get a higher percentage of our young men on missions. We strive to improve the numbers of those marrying in the temple. All of these are commendable efforts and important to the growth of the kingdom. But when individual members and families immerse themselves in the scriptures regularly and consistently, these other areas of activity will automatically come. Testimonies will increase. Commitment will be strengthened. Families will be fortified. Personal revelation will flow” (“The Power of the Word,” Ensign, May 1986, 81).

  

President Spencer W. Kimball declared: “I find that when I get casual in my relationships with divinity and when it seems that no divine ear is listening and no divine voice is speaking, that I am far, far away. If I immerse myself in the scriptures the distance narrows and the spirituality returns. I find myself loving more intensely those whom I must love with all my heart and mind and strength, and loving them more, I find it easier to abide their counsel” (Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Spencer W. Kimball [2006], 67).

  

President Marion G. Romney said: “I feel certain that if, in our homes, parents will read from the Book of Mormon prayerfully and regularly, both by themselves and with their children, the spirit of that great book will come to permeate our homes and all who dwell therein. The spirit of reverence will increase; mutual respect and consideration for each other will grow. The spirit of contention will depart. Parents will counsel their children in greater love and wisdom. Children will be more responsive and submissive to the counsel of their parents. Righteousness will increase. Faith, hope, and charity—the pure love of Christ—will abound in our homes and lives, bringing in their wake peace, joy, and happiness” (“The Book of Mormon,” Ensign, May 1980, 67).

  

President Boyd K. Packer said: “True doctrine, understood, changes attitudes and behavior. The study of the doctrines of the gospel will improve behavior quicker than a study of behavior will improve behavior” (“Do Not Fear,” Ensign or Liahona, May 2004, 79).

  

Elder David A. Bednar said: “Each family prayer, each episode of family scripture study, and each family home evening is a brushstroke on the canvas of our souls. No one event may appear to be very impressive or memorable. But just as the yellow and gold and brown strokes of paint complement each other and produce an impressive masterpiece, so our consistency in doing seemingly small things can lead to significant spiritual results” (“More Diligent and Concerned at Home,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2009, 19–20).
