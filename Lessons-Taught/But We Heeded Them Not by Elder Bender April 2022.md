## The Song

“…consider together how we can be strengthened to “heed not” the evil influences and mocking voices of the contemporary world in which we live.”

  

Heed = paying attention to or taking notice of something

  

The hymn encourages us to “pay no attention to what the wicked may say”

  

## Covenant Connection

“I witness that the connections with Him and Heavenly Father are real and are the ultimate sources of assurance, peace, joy, and the spiritual strength that enable us to “fear not, though the enemy deride.” “

  

“Valiant members often highlight the importance of inviting the power of the Holy Ghost into their lives through meaningful scripture study, fervent prayer, and proper preparation to participate in the ordinance of the sacrament.”

  

“First and foremost, these disciples have firm testimonies of Heavenly Father’s plan of happiness and the role of Jesus Christ as our Redeemer and Savior.”

  

“…second, their spiritual knowledge and conviction are individual, personal, and specific; they are not general and abstract… To these individuals, Jesus Christ indeed is a personal Savior.”

  

## Rod of Iron

““And [Nephi] said unto them that it was the word of God; and whoso would hearken unto the word of God, and would hold fast unto it, they would never perish; neither could the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary overpower them unto blindness, to lead them away to destruction.” “ 1 Nephi 15:23-24

  

“Please note that the ability to resist the temptations and the fiery darts of the adversary is promised to those individuals who “hold fast to” rather than merely “cling to” the word of God.”

  

  

  

## Questions for EQ

- How do the covenants you have made with the Lord help you “heed not” what the wicked may say? Do they even help at all?

- Elder Bednar notes a difference between those individuals who “hold fast” rather than merely “cling to” the word of God. What do you suppose he’s getting at? What’s the difference? Why is one method superior to the other?

- What can you do personally to “heed not” what the wicked may say over the next two weeks?

- Do you have a testimony of Jesus Christ in his role as our redeemer?

- How does one obtain a testimony of Jesus Christ?

- How does having a testimony of the plan of salvation and Jesus Christ as our savior and redeemer help us discern truth from error from the world’s messages?

- What activities might a person do when seeking a testimony?

- There are some iron rod path walkers who arrive at the tree of life, partake of the fruit, and then fall away because they are ashamed. How do you suppose this happens?

- Why is the world so tempting to heed?
