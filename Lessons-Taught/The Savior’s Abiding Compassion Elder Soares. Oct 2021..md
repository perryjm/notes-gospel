What is Compassion?

  

“Sympathetic consciousness of others' distress together with a desire to alleviate it” 

- Merriam Webster. Compassion.

  

“In the scriptures, compassion means literally “to suffer with.” It also means to show sympathy, pity, and mercy for another.” 

- Guide to the Scriptures. Compassion.

  

“Compassion is a fundamental characteristic of those who strive for sanctification” 

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“Jesus’s compassionate acts were …everyday expressions of the reality of His pure love for God and His children and His abiding desire to help them.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“Jesus was able to identify people’s needs even at a distance.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“…Jesus performed one of the most tender miracles of His earthly ministry when He commanded a dead young man, the only son of a widowed mother, to rise and live. Jesus sensed not only the intense suffering of that poor mother but also the difficult circumstances of her life, and He was moved by genuine compassion for her.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

  

Judging Others

  

“Jesus’s admonition to Simon the Pharisee also made it clear that we should never make harsh and cruel judgment of our neighbor, because we are all in need of understanding and mercy for our imperfections from our loving Heavenly Father.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“We need to consider that it is not easy to understand all the circumstances that contribute to someone’s attitude or reaction. Appearances can be deceptive and oftentimes do not represent an accurate measurement of someone’s behavior. Unlike you and me, Christ is capable of clearly seeing all facets of a given situation. Even knowing all our weaknesses as He does, the Savior does not rashly condemn us but continues to work with us compassionately over time, helping us to remove the beam from our eye. Jesus always looks on the heart and not on the appearance. He Himself declared, “Judge not according to the appearance.” “

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“In this context, the Lord fixes judgment upon those who take it upon themselves to judge the supposed shortcomings of others unrighteously. In order to qualify ourselves to make righteous judgments, we must strive to become like the Savior and look at the imperfections of individuals compassionately, even through His eyes.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

## Charity

  

“The pure love of Christ (Moro. 7:47); the love that Christ has for the children of men and that the children of men should have for one another (2 Ne. 26:30; 33:7–9; Ether 12:33–34); the highest, noblest, strongest kind of love, not merely affection.”

Story of the woman who washed the Savior’s feet with her tears. (Luke 7)

  

36 ¶ And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.

  

37 And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,

  

38 And stood at his feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.

  

39 Now when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it, he spake within himself, saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would have known who and what manner of woman this is that toucheth him: for she is a sinner.

  

40 And Jesus answering said unto him, Simon, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And he saith, Master, say on.

  

41 There was a certain creditor which had two debtors: the one owed five hundred pence, and the other fifty. [difference between a new car and a starter home]

  

42 And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him most?

  

43 Simon answered and said, I suppose that he, to whom he forgave most. And he said unto him, Thou hast rightly judged.

  

44 And he turned to the woman, and said unto Simon, Seest thou this woman? I entered into thine house, thou gavest me no water for my feet: but she hath washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.

  

45 Thou gavest me no kiss: but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet.

  

46 My head with oil thou didst not anoint: but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment.

  

47 Wherefore I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.

  

48 And he said unto her, Thy sins are forgiven.

  

49 And they that sat at meat with him began to say within themselves, Who is this that forgiveth sins also?

  

50 And he said to the woman, Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.

  

- Luke 7:36-50

  

  

  

## Insights From Jesus the Christ by James E Talmage

In the House of Simon the Pharisee

Simon the Pharisee’s Perspective

  

“And one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him. And he went into the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to meat.”

-Jesus the Christ. Talmage. Ch. 18.

  

“…[Jesus’] reception at Simon’s house appears to have been somewhat lacking in warmth, hospitality and honorable attendance. The narrative suggests an attitude of condescension on the part of the host. It was the custom of the times to treat a distinguished guest with marked attention; to receive him with a kiss of welcome, to provide water for washing the dust from his feet, and oil for anointing the hair of the head and the beard. All these courteous attentions were omitted by Simon.” 

-Jesus the Christ. Talmage. Ch. 18.

  

“Jesus took His place, probably on one of the divans or couches on which it was usual to partly sit, partly recline, while eating. Such an attitude would place the feet of the person outward from the table. In addition to these facts relating to the usages of the time it should be further remembered that dwellings were not protected against intrusion by such amenities of privacy as now prevail. It was not unusual at that time in Palestine for visitors and even strangers, usually men however, to enter a house at meal time, observe the procedure and even speak to the guests, all without bidding or invitation.”

-Jesus the Christ. Talmage. Ch. 18.

  

“…Seemingly oblivious of her surroundings and of disapproving eyes watching her movements, she shook out her tresses and wiped the Lord’s feet with her hair. Then, opening an alabaster box of ointment, she anointed them, as a slave might do to his master. Jesus graciously permitted the woman to proceed unrebuked and uninterrupted in her humble service inspired by contrition and reverent love.”

-Jesus the Christ. Talmage. Ch. 18.

  

“The Pharisee could not fail to note so direct a reminder of his having omitted the ordinary rites of respect to a specially invited guest. The lesson of the story had found its application in him, even as Nathan’s parable had drawn from David the king a self-convicting answer. “Wherefore,” Jesus continued, “I say unto thee, Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much: but to whom little is forgiven, the same loveth little.” Then to the woman He spake the words of blessed relief: “Thy sins are forgiven.” Simon and the others at table murmured within themselves, “Who is this that forgiveth sins also?” Understanding their unspoken protest, Christ addressed the woman again, saying, “Thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace.”

-Jesus the Christ. Talmage. Ch. 18.

  

## More on Simon the Pharisee by Elder Soares

  

“The Pharisee’s holier-than-thou attitude led him to judge unjustly both Jesus and the woman. But in His omniscience, the Savior knew Simon’s mind and, in great wisdom, challenged Simon’s condescending attitude, as well as admonished him for his lack of courtesy in receiving a special guest like the Savior into his home. In fact, Jesus’s direct rebuke of the Pharisee served as a witness that Jesus indeed possessed the gift of prophecy and that this woman, with a humble and contrite heart, was repentant and forgiven for her sins.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“Simon’s superiority complex, coupled with his hardened heart, prevented him from showing empathy for that repentant soul, and he referred even to the Savior of the world with indifference and contempt. His attitude revealed that his way of life was nothing more than a strict and hollow observance of rules and outward manifestations of his convictions through self-aggrandizement and false holiness.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

  

  

## Promised Blessings

  

“My dear friends, as we intentionally strive to incorporate a compassionate attitude into our way of life, as exemplified by the Savior, we will become more sensitive to people’s needs. With that increased sensitivity, feelings of genuine interest and love will permeate our every action.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“I testify that as we strive to incorporate the Savior’s compassionate example into our lives, our capacity to compliment the virtues of our neighbors will increase and our natural instinct to judge their imperfections will decrease.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“Our communion with God will grow, and certainly our lives will become sweeter, our feelings more tender, and we will find a never-ending source of happiness. We will be known as peacemakers, whose words are as gentle as the dew of a spring morning.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

“I pray that we will become more long-suffering and understanding of others and that the Lord’s mercy will, in perfect meekness, soothe our impatience with their imperfections.”

- Elder Soares. Nov 2021. The Savior’s Abiding Compassion.

  

## The Good Samaritan by Del Parson

  

One day a lawyer asked Jesus Christ, “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” The Savior asked what the lawyer thought that the law said he needed to do, and the lawyer replied, “Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbour as thyself.”

  

“Thou hast answered right: this do, and thou shalt live,” Jesus said.

  

“Who is my neighbour?” the man asked.

  

## Jesus answered by telling him a parable.

  

A Jewish man was traveling from Jerusalem to Jericho when thieves attacked him. They took his clothes, beat him, and left him near death.

  

When a Jewish priest came down the road and saw the wounded man, he crossed to the other side of the road to avoid him and continued his journey.

  

Next a Levite, also a citizen of Judah, approached. He looked at the wounded man, then he, too, crossed the road and went on his way without helping the man.

  

Finally a man from Samaria came along the road. The Jews and the Samaritans were bitter enemies, but the Samaritan saw that the injured man needed help. He bandaged the man’s wounds, put him on his pack animal, took him to an inn, and cared for the injured man there. When the Samaritan left the next day, he paid the innkeeper to look after the man until he got better. He promised that if caring for the man cost more, he would pay the innkeeper the next time he was there.

  

“Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves?” Jesus asked the lawyer.

When the lawyer said, “He that shewed mercy on him.” Jesus said, “Go, and do thou likewise.” (See Luke 10:25–37.)

  

We should each follow Jesus Christ’s example by loving and caring for one another. As we do, we will know that Jesus’ teachings are true and our faith in Him will grow.

## Cleft Palate Story

“I know a little girl who was born with very serious cleft lips and a cleft palate. She had to have the first of a series of many surgeries on the second day of her life. Moved by a genuine compassion for those who experience this same challenge, this girl and her parents seek to give support, understanding, and emotional assistance to others who face this difficult reality. They wrote to me recently and shared: “Through our daughter’s challenge, we had the opportunity to meet wonderful people who needed comfort, support, and encouragement. Some time ago, our daughter, who is 11 years old now, talked with the parents of a baby with the same challenge. During this conversation, our daughter momentarily took off the mask she was wearing due to the pandemic so the parents could see that there is hope, even though that baby still has a long way to go in the next few years to fix the problem. We feel very grateful for the opportunity to extend our empathy to those who suffer, as the Savior does for us. We feel we ease our pain every time we relieve someone else’s pain.” “
