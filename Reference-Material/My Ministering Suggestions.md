## My Suggestions For Ministering (Keep it Simple)
### 12/31/2023
- Don’t look for the minimum requirements to meet. 
- How would the Savior minister to your people? Just do that 
- Just ask your people how they’d like to be supported and loved. 
- It’s just like a mission. You should show the same devotion, love, and care as you try to help your investigators come closer to Jesus Christ.
- After home teaching was “adjusted“ into ministering, I participated in many frank discussions about it. People basically fell into three camps
	1. Happy to see home teaching go. “I’ve always felt there were so many problems with home teaching, it was so flawed, good riddance. I love that now you can just text people.”
	1. Frustrated at ministering arriving. “There’s no structure, it’s more awkward, people don’t know what to expect. So we’re not supposed to teach a lesson, what do I do? The accountability got me to go do something. Uh… you know you don’t need to show up at my door anymore…”
	1. The change made sense, they didn’t have an issue with it.
- For the first two groups, fundamentally, they were looking to do the minimum required.
- For the third group, home teaching was never broken. And ministering didn’t feel all that different. They were likely approaching their home teaching assignment the way the Savior would. And now in ministering, they’re likely still approaching their assignment the way the Savior would. So labels didn’t matter.

- The Lord expects us to do our ministering. 
- The Lord commanded us to do it 
- The Savior did it. 
- He walked to peoples homes and told them what was up 
- 100% ministering score. It’s not about numbers, except we do still track them. 
- **What counts as ministering?**
- “Everything counts. So report it all.” Jeffrey r Holland. 2016. 
- "Lift your vision of home teaching. Please, in newer, better ways see yourselves as emissaries of the Lord to His children." Jeffrey r Holland. 2016. 
- "What matters most is that you love your people and are fulfilling the commandment to 'watch over the Church always.'" Jeffrey r Holland. 2016. 
- “We will no longer use home teaching and visiting teaching language. That is partly because much of our ministering effort will be in settings other than the home and partly because our contact won’t be defined by teaching a prepared lesson, though a lesson certainly may be shared if there is need for such. The primary purpose in this ministering idea will be, as was said of the people in Alma’s day, to “watch over their people, and … nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness.” “
- Elder Holland. 2018.
- “We will continue to visit homes as possible, but local circumstances such as large numbers, long distances, personal safety, and other challenging conditions may preclude a visit to every home every month. As the First Presidency counseled years ago, do the best you can. In addition to whatever schedule you establish for actual visits, that calendar can be supplemented with telephone calls, written notes, texts, emails, video chats, conversations at Church meetings, shared service projects, social activities, and a host of possibilities in the world of social media. However, I should stress that this expansive new view does not include the sorry statement I recently saw on an automobile bumper sticker. It read, “If I honk, you’ve been home taught.” Please, please, brethren (the sisters would never be guilty of that—I speak to the brethren of the Church), with these adjustments we want more care and concern, not less.”
- Elder Holland. 2018.
- “With this newer, more gospel-based concept of ministering, I feel you starting to panic about what counts on the report. Well, relax, because there isn’t any report —at least not the 31st-of-the-month, “I made it through the door by the skin of my teeth” report. Here too we are trying to mature. The only report that will be made is the number of interviews leaders had with the ministering companionships in the ward that quarter. Simple as that sounds, my friends, those interviews are absolutely crucial. Without that information the bishop will have no way to receive the information he needs regarding the spiritual and temporal conditions of his people. Remember: ministering brethren represent the bishopric and elders quorum presidency; they don’t replace them. The keys of a bishop and a quorum president go far beyond this ministering concept.”
- Elder Holland. 2018
- “Because this report is different from anything you have submitted in the past, let me stress that we at Church headquarters don’t need to know how or where or when you make contact with your people; we just need to know and care that you do make it and that you bless them in every way you can.”
- Elder Holland. 2018
