## My Suggestions For Ministering (Keep it Simple)
12/31/2023
- Don’t look for the minimum requirements to meet. 
- How would the Savior minister to your people? Just do that 
- Just ask your people how they’d like to be supported and loved. 
- It’s just like a mission. You should show the same devotion, love, and care as you try to help your investigators come closer to Jesus Christ.
- After home teaching was “adjusted“ into ministering, I participated in many frank discussions about it. People basically fell into three camps
	1. Happy to see home teaching go. “I’ve always felt there were so many problems with home teaching, it was so flawed, good riddance. I love that now you can just text people.”
	1. Frustrated at ministering arriving. “There’s no structure, it’s more awkward, people don’t know what to expect. So we’re not supposed to teach a lesson, what do I do? The accountability got me to go do something. Uh… you know you don’t need to show up at my door anymore…”
	1. The change made sense, they didn’t have an issue with it.
- For the first two groups, fundamentally, they were looking to do the minimum required.
- For the third group, home teaching was never broken. And ministering didn’t feel all that different. They were likely approaching their home teaching assignment the way the Savior would. And now in ministering, they’re likely still approaching their assignment the way the Savior would. So labels didn’t matter.
