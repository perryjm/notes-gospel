# Things are Bad

Things are bad right now for me.Â 

  

Iâ€™m not taking care of myself. Iâ€™m 50LBs over weight. I havenâ€™t studied the word of god for a few months it feels like. I havenâ€™t been to the temple to do ordinances for the dead Â since getting my new recommend at the beginning of March! ðŸ˜©Â 

  

Things are bad.Â 

  

Iâ€™m over eating at every meal. Iâ€™m playing video games every moment I can. Iâ€™m ignoring my children. Iâ€™m ignoring my wife. When things get better. Iâ€™m drinking way too much caffeine. Way too much sugar. Iâ€™m stressed out at work. And when Iâ€™m not stressed out at work Iâ€™m stressed out because Iâ€™m not stressed out.Â 

  

Iâ€™m watching TV every single night. Feeding every appetite and yet ironically starving my spirit. Maybe itâ€™s not irony, just fitting, and sadâ€¦
