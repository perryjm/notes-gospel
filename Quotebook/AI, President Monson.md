"Man can devise the most complex machines but cannot give them life or bestow upon them the powers of reason and judgment. These are divine gifts, bestowed only by God." ([Guided Safely Home](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2014/10/guided-safely-home?lang=eng&id=p7#p7), President Thomas S. Monson)
