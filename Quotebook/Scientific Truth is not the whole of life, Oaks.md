“The methods of science lead us to what we call scientific truth. But “scientific truth” is not the whole of life. Those who do not learn “by study and also by faith” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118) limit their understanding of truth to what they can verify by scientific means. That puts artificial limits on their pursuit of truth.” -- Elder Dallin H. Oaks, [Source]((https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

Science produces scientific truth, and scientific truth is not the whole of life. What a good way to say that. That’s amazing.
