“The methods of science lead us to what we call scientific truth. But “scientific truth” is not the whole of life. Those who do not learn “by study and also by faith” (Doctrine and Covenants 88:118) limit their understanding of truth to what they can verify by scientific means. That puts artificial limits on their pursuit of truth.

...

"We find true and enduring joy by coming to know and acting upon the truth about who we are, the meaning of mortal life, and where we are going when we die. Those truths cannot be learned by scientific or secular methods."

[Elder Dallin H. Oaks Truth and the Plan. October 2018.](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan?lang=eng&id=p8#p8)

Science produces scientific truth, and scientific truth is not the whole of life. What a good way to say that. That’s amazing.
