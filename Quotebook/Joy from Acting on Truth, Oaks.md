"We find true and enduring joy by coming to know and acting upon the truth about who we are, the meaning of mortal life, and where we are going when we die. Those truths cannot be learned by scientific or secular methods." ([Truth and the Plan](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2018/10/truth-and-the-plan?lang=eng&id=p10#p10), Elder Oaks)
