# Friends everywhere to everybody
"We should be friends everywhere and to everybody. There is no Latter-day Saint that hates the world: but we are friends to the world, we are obliged to be, so far as they are concerned. We must learn to extend our charity and labor in the interests of all mankind. This is the mission of the Latter-day Saintsâ€”not simply confine it to ourselves, but to spread it abroad, as it of necessity must be extended to all mankind." - Lorenzo Snow.
