1. Feasting on the words of Christ, as found in the scriptures, stimulates personal revelation. Elder Robert D. Hales said: “When we want to speak to God, we pray. And when we want Him to speak to us, we search the scriptures.”
2. “no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in this church excepting my servant Joseph Smith … until I shall appoint … another in his stead.” Doctrine, commandments, and revelations for the Church are the prerogative of the living prophet, who receives them from the Lord Jesus Christ. That is the prophet’s runway… You can receive revelation, for example, about where to live, what career path to follow, or whom to marry. Church leaders may teach doctrine and share inspired counsel, but the responsibility for these decisions rests with you. That is your revelation to receive; that is your runway.
3. personal revelation will be in harmony with the commandments of God and the covenants we have made with Him. When we ask for revelation about something for which God has already given clear direction, we open ourselves up to misinterpreting our feelings and hearing what we want to hear… this exception [of Nephi slaying Laban] does not negate the rule—the rule that personal revelation will be in harmony with God’s commandments.
4. recognize what God has already revealed to you personally, while being open to further revelation from Him… [Story of lost 116 pages, Joseph asked and received a “no” answer twice.] “Seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For … he counseleth in wisdom.” …[example of people asking to be forgiven for the same things even after receiving a answer that they already have been forgiven]… Even as we trust God’s prior answers, we need to be open to further personal revelation… We should recognize that personal revelation may be received “line upon line” and “precept upon precept,” that revealed direction can be and frequently is incremental.

The elements of the framework for personal revelation are overlapping and mutually reinforcing.
