**Why is a covenant so freaking important?** 

It’s not like, when I die, I actually want people to say of me, “he was a covenant keeper.” No. They’re going to talk of love. Knowing that I made a commitment has never stopped me from sinning. It’s not like, when I’m mad, I think to myself, oh snap, I better not get too mad, because then I’ll be at risk of breaking the agreement I made with God back when I was 23.

  

You know?

  

“All roads lead to the temple, for it is there that we are prepared in all things to qualify us to enter the presence of the Lord”

“The ordinances and covenants of the temple are not merely important to our exaltation—they are essential. President Packer further explained, “Ordinances and covenants become our credentials for admission into [God’s] presence. To worthily receive them is the quest of a lifetime; to keep them thereafter is the challenge of mortality” (Boyd K. Packer, “Covenants,” Ensign, May 1987). Faithfully obeying covenants made with God is the most important goal we can pursue in this life. In the words of President Russell M. Nelson, “The greatest compliment that can be earned here in this life is to be known as a covenant keeper. The rewards for a covenant keeper will be realized both here and hereafter” “ (Russell M. Nelson, “Covenants,” Ensign, Nov. 2011).
