Sometimes, it’s hard for me to fathom life without my upbringing. Life without all the bedrock of gospel doctrine and principles intuitively understood, essentially the testimony I already have. I don’t know how to contrast viewpoints without a “lifelong member” lens. 

  

So, I cop this frustrated attitude with the temple, like, “psh, the endowment is symbolic!? Symbolic of what!?” “If it’s not a true and accurate historical record of what took place then I’m out.”

  

I discount and judge it’s value, thinking, “well, since it’s not helping me answer the questions I want answered right now in this moment, then, it’s no good.“

  

And I totally take for granted that I grew up under goodly parents. Parents who loved me, loved each other, most importantly loved the Lord and wanted to do right by Him, and taught me the ways of God by the Spirit. Consistently. Year over year all growing up, this happened. 

  

So, I’m lucky, but I’m also spoiled. I am the fish who lives in water, and wonders what it means to be wet. Is it any wonder??
