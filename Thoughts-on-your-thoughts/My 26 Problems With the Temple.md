# Mike's 26 Problems With the Temple

Parents,

Believe it or not, I’m actually hunting for solutions, and do already have a lot of solutions to these problems. But I thought this might be helpful to share with you two. I know you have new callings that deal with these matters. 

I numbered them for convenience in case you have comments you’d like to make about specifics. 

  

## Problem/Solution Analysis Regarding the Temple  
By Mike Perry  
July 9, 2023  
  
### Impediments to Learning  
1. No note taking or journaling in the temple - No notes in or out, no writing, no journaling. You can't really attempt to collect your thoughts in writing form for later analysis while you’re having the thought in the temple.

  
2. Limited official published study materials on the temple - granted, there is more than ever before, but yet, still the majority of what goes on in a temple is unpublished and considered something that you should not publicize.

3. Impossibility to pause, rewind, or discuss - you cannot stop an initiatory and ask questions. You cannot pause a sealer and ask him what a particular phrase means. You cannot pause an endowment session and ask them to back up 10 seconds. The things you normally do when studying content, you can’t do. No good redress either. Options: wait until the end and discuss is with a friend or companion after it’s all finished in the celestial room, which will get you some stern jiffy looks. Or wait until leaving the temple to write down your thoughts. But wait, you’re not supposed to discuss the ordinances outside the temple... 

  
4. Secret elements - “We do not discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples” (preparing to enter the holy temple, 2) -there are a number of things that cannot be talked about. I never hear general authorities or church leaders discuss these things. There are specific things in the endowment that you promise you will never reveal. This secrecy does not lend itself to study and learning. Almost everything about the initiatory cannot be talked about, similar for the sealing. The words of covenants. Grips, meanings, symbols. The true order of prayer. Various symbols in clothing worn. The boundary between what’s ok and not ok to talk about is so unclear, I see most people erring on the side of not talking about any of it, ever. I am unable to obtain any official copy of any of the official words in any of the ceremonies of the temple. Temple workers get to read them all the time. But I am not permitted as a “common” patron. This is Inconsistent with other ordinances like the sacrament or baptism which are widely published and very clear.

  
5. No succinct list of all the things you promise to do in the temple. There are interesting resources. But this does not show everything. In the endowment, for example, it’s very unclear what is sacred and a covenant vs. other things that are just explanation. Similar in the initiatory and sealing ordinances. What if I just want to know all the things I have committed to do? Why is that SUCH A MYSTERY? That’s supposed to be MY end of the bargain that I alone am responsible for upholding. Why is it in any way elusive? Other things including veil ceremony when married.

6. All ceremonies are really only done once for yourself. Once in your whole life. The only time you hear things again is when you go back for the dead or are a temple worker. The only logical conclusion from being exposed one time in your whole life, is the material really isn’t that important. But all indicators from church leaders, etc. claim the total opposite. The things happening in the temple are perhaps the only thing in life and eternity that matter. ![😏](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f60f/32.png)![🙇‍♂️](https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/e/notoemoji/15.0/1f647_200d_2642_fe0f/32.png)  
  
  
### Distractions  
7. Too busy a schedule - multiple good things competing for limited hours. Struggle to carve out time to visit the temple due to competing priorities, like work, family responsibilities, church and community responsibilities, and personal health. 

  
8. Mind wanders when in the temple

  
9. Participation in ceremonies with complete strangers. Physical actions of rites - required to touch people and be touched. Lots of quick eye contact and awkward eye contact aversions. Tends to interrupt whatever mental pondering I may have.

  
10. Voice actors are distracting. Temple workers and officiators are distracting. Is it supposed to be? Is it not supposed to be? The temple doesn’t seem to be intended as a social experience, yet, you constantly interact with others.

  
11. If I had a nickel for every awkward glance I exchanged with a complete stranger in the temple, I’d be a rich man.

  
12. Tight fitting attire.  
  
  
### Unresolved Questions  
13. Unresolved questions impede my ability to learn and distract me. And I have no adequate forum to ask them.

  
14. Confused about the symbolic depiction of interactions between characters like Adam and Eve and Peter, James and John and Satan. How can those characters be interacting at all? It is depicted as a historical account, yet it’s part fiction. Aka inaccurate. It’s not a historical account. The events portrayed didn’t actually happen that way, so, what way did they happen?  
  
### Difficulty Understanding Symbolism  
15. There are a number of impediments to understanding symbolism

  
16. Brain to strung out on media and overstimulated by movies and marketing

  
17. Attention economy stands in direct opposition to peace calmness, deep pondering about symbols seen in the house of the Lord.

  
18. No way of validating or verifying interpretations made about symbols in the temple. No official compendium, or source of truth about it, aside from asking the Lord in prayer. Even seeing some of the design plans of a particular temple would be helpful. What architectural elements were specifically designed for symbols? It seems this information is known, but not published.

  
19. Feels like seeing pictures in the clouds. Brain is out of practice with seeing these types of abstract or architectural or artistic connections with gospel principles.

### Genealogy Culture  
20. Pressure to do genealogical research and to take your own family names to the temple. If you’re not doing that, then you’re not doing it right. And get out of the way of the real genealogy researchers who are doing your work for you. 

21. Everyone always has names that you’re supposed to be taking to the temple, so feel guilty if you don’t. 

  
22. Pressure to have positive emotional experiences associated with your ancestors while at the temple. Anecdotal stories told by family or strangers about seeing or sensing relatives in the temple. In some circles there’s pressure to feel a connection with the names you are taking to the temple.

### Appointment Scheduling System  
23. It's now a pseudo-requirement to make a reservation with the temple before you attend, and then attend during the scheduled time. When an appointment isn't made, you feel you are burdening the temple staff with exceptional procedure. 

24. There is also great difficulty in scheduling an appointment (seventeen clicks vs. two clicks to order pizza). 

25. There is also a lack of prime time availability in the temple's schedule. For example, Provo City Center Temple is booked four weeks in advance from 6pm - 8pm each weeknight. 

  
26. Also, adds pressure to being somewhere by a specific time or else, you might lose your time slot, or not keep your commitments. Which adds unnecessary distraction to the moments just before entering the temple.
