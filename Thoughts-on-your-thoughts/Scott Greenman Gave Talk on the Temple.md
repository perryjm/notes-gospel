## President Russel M. Nelson's comments about the temple from recent conferences

April 2021 – Ordinances of the temple fill our lives with power and strength available in no other way.

  

October 2021 - … please make time for the Lord in His holy house. Nothing will strengthen your spiritual foundation like temple service and temple worship.

  

April 2022 - Positive spiritual momentum increases as we worship in the temple and grow in our understanding of the magnificent breadth and depth of the blessings we receive there. I plead with you to counter worldly ways by focusing on the eternal blessings of the temple. Your time there brings blessings for eternity.

  

October 2022 - I promise that increased time in the temple will bless your life in ways nothing else can.

  

April 2023 - Jesus Christ is the reason we build temples. Each is His holy house. Making covenants and receiving essential ordinances in the temple, as well as seeking to draw closer to Him there, will bless your life in ways no other kind of worship can.

Jeff Hunt said something _very_ interesting and timely for me. A reminder. Some of the Jews during Christs time heard his sayings and could not understand them for the truth that the Lord intended. They heard His sayings and got angry, they reviled him, they wanted to crucify him. The Nephites (many of the evil ones died, but those that remained…) heard new sayings from Christ and repented. Jeff said he felt the scriptures many times were actually written to purposely be a little confusing so that you would need the spirit to really get the deeper meanings. Intentionally confusing? That doesn’t sound like the Lord, but guess what.. it is that way. I’ve seen it myself too. It’s frustratingly confusing at times. Probably because of Satan really.. Confusing men through time. 

  

So, the big pay off here, is you need the Spirit to understand deep meanings. Now, enter my Temple study recently. I need the Spirit with me, to make sense of these confusing points.
