# Expository on Change

Aug 16, 2022 at 7:28 AM

When I repented of breaking the law of chastity, I don’t feel my nature was changed. I never felt the Lord take away my attraction toward n the opposite sex. Did I feel I greater desire to serve others and not focus on myself? Absolutely. Did I feel a desire to never break the law of chastity again? Totally. Did my outward behavior change in the form of stopping the sin and continue oh to go to school and church and service activities? Yes and yes. 

So that’s it. Kind of. It’s not about who you are in the eyes of God drastically becoming someone else entirely. At least not in my experience. It’s about the Lord cleansing you, and helping you, and the spirit working within you to bring about good behavior. And that good behavior may make it seem to some like you’re a totally different person because, “wow! He’s not a slobbering drunk anymore! And he can hold down a job!” Well yeah, that’s going to seem like a dramatic change to someone’s nature. But to me that’s not a change in their nature. That’s giving their soul a bath, and washing away all the gunk and mud and grime that got stuck under the bunkers and wheel wells for years and years and years. And now it drives like a new car. You give the guy a hair cut and a beard trim and the difference is dramatic. But did the persons personality and vibrancy and natural gifts and talents suddenly shift forever and become something new entirely? Well no. I don’t think so. 

At least, not normally. I can’t speak for everyone’s experience of change. I only know my own and those around me. And that’s how it seems to be. 

What about this though. Some people change from being very quiet and reserved to very open and outgoing and supportive of others. 

I have a working definition up above about “nature” but that definition fails in its ambiguity. At this point I think I’m deliberating over semantics. Does nature refer to someone’s behavior? Their outward appearance? The affect they have in others? Core personality traits? Someone’s life history and upbringing? The gifts talents and abilities they were born with? What is someone’s nature?

If someone says a person used to be selfish and an old grouch and a hermit and now they’re out and about serving in the community and always smiling and talking with and helping others, they could rightly argue that that persons nature had changed. Right? 

Some intangible characteristics which seemed to almost define that person (selfish grouch) have completely switched and now they are a selfless kind-hearted person to others. That sure seems like a change to their nature. 

But maybe you could call it a trip through forgiveness ally, maybe a dunk in the pond of unselfish love, and a long sit at the bench outside the school of “life’s too short to be mean”. And what’s the end result? Their soul has been purified by the love of Jesus Christ and His matchless atoning power and His forgiveness and grace, and that blend washed away all the anger and disappointment and fear this person had been encumbered with for three last 45 years. And once that 80 pound pack was removed off their back, they felt so light and happy they couldn’t help but leap for joy and run around doing good for everyone they could see. 

I mean, why not?

So once again, it’s a semantics game. The man’s mother would argue, oh yes, that’s just as I remember him as a boy. Running around, happy, talking with everyone, smiling. 

But close friends he gained at his most recent job only knew about the drinking and the anger and betrayal he felt after the divorce. So to them, they never knew this sweet little boy his mother is talking about. 

Isn’t that what we’re talking about here?

Isn’t it change? Yes. 

Experiences have the ability to change us, to shape us, if we let them. But similarly, they have the ability to drag us down. So when they say our nature changes, we become a new creature. I would say, no, we’re restored. We’re restored almost to a state of innocence. The Lord can reset us back to our former glory. He can fix us. Repair us. It’s not that we’re a new person with no memory of the past and a new upbringing and a new set of weaknesses to overcome. It’s that our backpack of heavy burdens and negative emotions and trauma and baggage that is getting built up was emptied and we can stand up straight, and the fog dissipates and we can see clearly how life truly is. It’s less that we’re changed, and more that we’re cleaned. 

it’s not that 30 year old Dan now acts like he’s 10. It’s that all the zeal for life Dan had when he was 10 has been restored to him at 30. Despite him having some negative experiences that jaded him for a while. 

A fat guy losing weight, 80 pounds. Playing sports and eating healthy. Some might say, wow, it’s like he’s a totally different person now. Sure, that expression fits. But the fat guy knows, he felt that change of heart because he prayed in earnest to his lord because he felt utterly trapped in his fat man body. And wanted out. 

So, did his nature change? Or did his soul get a bath and he’s feeling lighter, physically and spiritually? Did the core personality traits that made him him shift and change into new personality traits? I don’t see it that way, personally. But I guess to some that is how it seems. 

If you think of a personality trait as “ loves video games and eating fast food, a real foodie,” well then yeah, you’re likely going to see a personality change in this guy losing 80 pounds and stopping those activities and cultivating new hobbies and interests. Yeah. 

But to me it’s the same core person. The same essence that makes them them. You’ll see the same mannerisms of that guy out on the soccer field as you did in the video game world, if you were paying attention. In fact, to me, this is the most beautiful part about this whole thing. Change. And the Lord and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He doesn’t change your whole nature. He lets you keep all of that. You just have your weaknesses bridled back down, and your strengths shine bright. It’s like a T-Shirt that looks good on literally everyone. “Oh, that’s a good color on you, Bill!”

You’re still that same core person, but you’re such a beautiful more full and sensible and palatable version of yourself that it feels to everyone like you’re a completely different person. But you’re not. Some subtle core changes happened, yes, with your relationship with God and sin, and addiction. Those changes were deep, yes. But again, deep soul changes I would characterize as your soul getting a bath, and knocking off the mud and dirt, and you’re actually being restored and cleansed. 

Think of restoring an old car. Or a new car that’s been treated terribly.
