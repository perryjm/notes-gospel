# Excerpts from Father's Blessings

## 2011-08-07 (ish)
"As you seek the council of your Heavenly Father in prayer... As you turn to Him in the scriptures and build each day, one day at a time, one scripture at a time, one prayer at a time, moment by moment, ... You will become a great fortress on behalf of our Heavenly Father and his kingdom. Many will stand behind you as their defense. It is for this purpose that you have been born here."
