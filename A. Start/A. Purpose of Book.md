# Purpose of Book
Project- Gospel principles knowledge base

## What Is It?

- Mobile-first, high availability knowledge base. Offline available.
- Terse
- Organized topically. By gospel principle. It is a principle-based work.
- Is Faith a principle or a topic? It doesn’t matter, there will be an entry on Faith.
- The litmus test for success

- Can I pull out my phone (with no internet access) in the middle of a discussion with someone, and within a few taps be able to search up a topic like “Faith” and to quickly read my own brief working definition of Faith, and see scripture references (with links) to exactly the verses I studied that very morning so I can share with the person I’m in the middle of a conversation with.
- Deliver a sacrament meeting talk straight out of this knowledge base

  

## What Is It Not?

- Not a Journal
- Not a scrapbook
- Not a therapeutic free-writing exercise

- Where I find my thought finally after a couple pages have been written
- Where I am tempted to merely “attach” the article in with this index

## Why?

- I really want to do this, I have wanted to do this for a long time. 
- I feel the Lord pushing me to do this. 
- I think it will GREATLY enhance my working knowledge of the gospel generally 
- and increase my ability to respond to people. It must be organized by principle. 
- I started doing this on my mission and felt it beneficial

  

## Why did I take down “Abide the Day” blog?

That blog was just too public and open and it got weird for me. And then I had that online altercation with ex-mormons subreddit and I took it all down. Essentially, I got scared. They were bully’s and threatening. They were threatening, I was nervous they could find out where I lived, I realized I hadn’t been careful in protecting my privacy online. I also was working for FamilySearch and didn’t want my behavior (responding to them angrily) to reflect poorly on me or the church at the time.

  

But the ultimate reason I took it down and never brought it back online is because, generally, I was writing to myself and the fictionalized ‘reader with an understanding heart.’ You know? I took it down because there seemed to be no readers visiting with understanding hearts anymore. And I was single and awkward.

  
## Markdown Resources

- [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
- This knowledge base will be private, secured online behind a username and password and MFA. 
- It’s backed up on GitHub and that’s where it will stay. 
- Github’s future is pretty solid. I like it a lot. 
- I’m using open source tools. No `$$` cost overhead. And I can find other tools if these stop being supported. 
- The content is in markdown.
- I own the content the raw content, it’s not tied up in some tools fate, like Evernote or OneNote or these other paid tiers. 
- How I view and edit the content may change over time, that’s fine. But like the internet itself, it’s built on webpages, and that content isn’t owned by the viewer.
