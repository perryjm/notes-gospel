When you attend the temple, you go to the locker room and change out of your “street” clothes and into your “white” clothes. Everyone wears all white, except for aprons which are green.

  

Possible Meanings

- Purity/cleanliness - “washed clean by the blood of the lamb” begins endowment. [Temple recommend interview questions](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/manual/general-handbook/26-temple-recommends?lang=eng&id=title_number30#title_number30). If not keeping commandments denied a recommend.
    
- Unity/Uniform - The Lords team color seems to be white. Every time the Lord or His Son appear they are wearing white robes. Every angel appears in white robes.
    
- Equalizer, the clothing is all inexpensive and the same look. No worldly indicators of wealth. A prince and a pauper could sit next to each other and you would have no idea what each one does outside of the temple based on their looks.
    

  

Hindrances 

- Wrist watches can still be worn
    
- Earrings can still be worn 
    
- The outward appearance can look clean though inwardly you might not be clean. 
    
- Your church shirt may be stained or grayed.
    
- Military wear brown garments. Police officers wear black. I’m jealous.
    

  

Scriptural Examples
